## What is the (draft) title of your research (max 50 words)?

Managing business processes for regulatory compliance: Design science research

(for sure include preliminary model)

## Which research question do you want to answer (max 150 words)?

Regulated industries, such as financial services, are faced with a steady flow of changes imposed by regulatory bodies. Boards need to ensure the companies they oversee comply with current regulations.
With reference to the six core elements of business process management (Rosemann and vom Brocke, 2015), my research is about the governance element of business process management (BPM). The research will follow the Design science paradigm (Hevner et al., 2004).

The research question is:

RQ. Can the adoption of industry specific standard processes increase BPM agility and help the Board create value from BPM?

Sub research questions are how aspects of standard processes either facilitate or hinder value creation and agility. In line with the design science research approach the sub questions correspond to different artifact contributions:

- How is regulatory compliance measured and reported in practice?
- How can boards simulate system changes with respect to regulatory compliance?
- Which are the commonalities between governance, risk and control systems and BPM?
- How can real-life business process management cases in the financial services industry be classified and summarized?

## Search two academic papers on this topic. Which of the two papers did you find most interesting and why (max 500 words)?

Considering the preliminary stage of my research project I have first focused on obtaining an overview of the research field.

The proceedings from the 2021 BPM conference have helped getting an overview of ongoing research and the associated community (Artem Polyvyanyy et al., 2021). While most of the presentations deal with technical aspects of BPM, there is also a management track. One paper I found of interest that resulted from this conference describes current BPM problems and suggestions for research (Beerepoot et al., 2021).

A publication of bundled papers describing real-life cases of BPM (Vom Brocke and Mendling, 2018) made me realize there are already many case studies available. Some of these case studies are around my research subject. “Compliance” is mentioned in the title of 1 of 37 BPM cases. One paper I found of interest in this collection deals with an application of flexible processes at a financial institution in Denmark (Debois et al., 2018).

Other than considering the research field overview I have scanned papers dealing with BPM and (regulatory) compliance to get ideas for possible follow-on research. There are several current and recurring themes touching upon my research subject. The desire for BPM initiatives to demonstrate value (Sadiq et al., 2021), the necessity for certain business processes to be aligned with organizational goals (Sadiq and Governatori, 2009) , and the need for a cross-organizational view on BPM (Eshuis and Grefen, 2008).
