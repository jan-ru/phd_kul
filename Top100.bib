To evaluate BPMLs, a general framework is required. Although a lot of BPMLs are available in research and industry, an established evaluation framework as well as a comprehensive evaluation of BPMLs is missing. To bridge this gap, we propose a generic meta-model that captures a wide range of process concepts and evaluate seven BPMLs based on this meta-model.},

  abstract = {Spreadsheets contain a huge amount of high-value data but do not observe a standard data model and thus are difficult to integrate. A large number of data integration tools exist, but they generally can only work on relational data. Existing systems for extracting relational data from spreadsheets are too labor intensive to support ad-hoc integration tasks, in which the correct extraction target is only learned during the course of user interaction.This paper introduces a system that automatically extracts relational data from spreadsheets, thereby enabling relational spreadsheet integration. The resulting integrated relational data can be queried directly or can be translated into RDF triples. When compared to standard techniques for spreadsheet data extraction on a set of 100 random Web spreadsheets, the system reduces the amount of human labor by 72\% to 92\%. In addition to the system design, we present the results of a general survey of more than 400,000 spreadsheets we downloaded from the Web, giving a novel view of how users organize their data in spreadsheets.},

  abstract = {Project Risk Registers have been used extensively for many years. However, they do not account for the interaction between risks, for example, the occurrence of one risk exacerbating other risks or portfolios of risks being more significant than the sum of the individual risks. This leads to the need to consider `risk systemicity' as a part of risk analysis. This paper reports on a specific case for a large multinational project based organization, one that the authors had been involved with in the analysis of a number of projects that had massive cost overruns. Following these analyses the organization was persuaded of the importance of risk systemicity. The organization therefore engaged the authors to develop a `Risk Filter'. This filter is a tool for identifying areas of risk exposure on future projects and creating a framework for their investigation. The `Risk Filter' is now used on all projects ever since its introduction; by the end of May 2003 it had been used by nine divisions, on over 60 major projects, and completed by 450 respondents. It is also used at several stages during the life of a project to aid in the risk assessment and management of each project, and contributes to a project database.

The popularity of the concept has led to an explosion of TQM-related literature. A careful review of the literature suggests that most publications recount the experiences or perceptions of the authors or deal with single case organisations. Furthermore, there is a dearth of empirical research and literature dealing with TQM's implementation process. This paper reports the findings of a research project that empirically examined the process of TQM implementation in a sample of organisations widely regarded as leading exponents of TQM. The paper presents a non-prescriptive model of the TQM implementation process derived from the findings and proposes an ``outcome driven'' approach as an alternative to the more commonplace TQM implementation strategies.},

  abstract = {Emerging technologies have capabilities to reshape business process management (BPM) from its traditional version to a more explorative variant. However, to exploit the full benefits of new IT, it is essential to reveal BPM's research potential and to detect recent trends in practice. Therefore, this work presents a systematic literature review (SLR) with 231 recent academic articles (from 2014 until May 2019) that integrate BPM with digital innovations (DI). We position those articles against seven future BPM-DI trends that were inductively derived from an expert panel. By complementing the expected trends in practice with a state-of-the-art literature review, we are able to derive covered and uncovered themes in order to help bridge a rigor-relevance gap. The major technological impacts within the BPM field seem to focus on value creation, customer engagement and managing human-centric and knowledge-intensive business processes. Finally, our findings are categorized into specific calls for research and for action to let scholars and organizations better prepare for future digital needs.},

Contrary to prior research, results indicate the level of risk from inadequate communication is not significantly greater when team members are not grouped in one location. Further, despite increased dependence of virtual teams on technology for communication, there was no evidence of significantly more project risk due to technological failure. However, virtual team projects exhibited notably more risk due to insufficient knowledge transfer. A plausible explanation is decreased implicit or informal knowledge transfer in virtual environments. We conclude that the possibility of insufficient knowledge transfer should be included in virtual project risk management plans, and consideration should be given in such projects to the extent to which knowledge that is traditionally shared implicitly might be shared explicitly through electronic means.},

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams.

Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

  abstract = {The ``expectations gap'' refers to differences in views of auditors and users regarding the extent of assurance obtained from auditing procedures. One aspect of the expectations gap considered by prior research is whether users differentiate the level of assurance provided by different audit procedures. We extend that research by studying whether investors understand that information outside of the financial statements, in the 10-K as well as on corporate websites, is not audited. This research is important, as the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board currently is considering proposals aimed at clarifying or expanding the auditor's responsibility for that information. We surveyed professional and nonprofessional investors, and find that professionals are more likely than nonprofessionals to correctly identify which 10-K components are audited. However, many investors in both groups believe that information outside of the financial statements is audited when in fact it is not. We also find some evidence that investors use certain information categories more often when they believe that the information is audited. Also, for both investor groups, responses concerning whether currently unaudited information categories should be audited suggest an unmet demand for greater assurance on information outside of the financial statements. Our results support proposals for greater clarity in the audit opinion concerning the nature of procedures performed on information outside of the financial statements. Further, our findings imply that additional assurance on that information might be considered useful.},

It is therefore helpful for quality engineers and statisticians to be familiar with basic quality management principles. In this article we discuss Dr. Joseph M. Juran's important contributions to modern quality management concepts, principles, and models. Many people have contributed to modern quality management. However, through his extensive writings covering more than six decades, Juran has managed to distill and synthesize the subject. He has provided us with a coherent framework and terminology and anticipated many of the principles that subsequently became incorporated under the Six Sigma umbrella. We briefly outline Juran's framework and discuss a number of key contributions he has made to the subject of managing for quality.

Although the two countries exhibit some similarities, there are important differences in legal systems, capital markets, and corporate governance mechanisms. The disclosure model developed is based on the main headings specified in the Fourth and Seventh European Union Directives. Based on this model, disclosure by U.K. companies is more comprehensive than by Dutch corporations and the difference is significant (5 percent level with two-tailed test). Most of the key areas of disclosure are found to be more comprehensive in the U.K. than in The Netherlands. This is due to more stringent regulation in the U.K. than in The Netherlands where the approach is more flexible. The model is used to establish whether disclosure is related to a number of firm-specific characteristics using regression analysis. The impact of size is the same for both countries, but other firm-specific characteristics have different effects.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the prospects for cumulative theory development in organization theory. Organization theory generally takes organizations (business corporations, nonprofits, hospitals, universities, etc.) as discrete and meaningful units of analysis. The revolution in information and communication technologies (ICTs) over the past two decades has made comprehensive time-series data on millions of organizations widely available to scholars around the world. Yet, it is not obvious that organization theory has become more precise, more general, or more accurate as a result. The author argues that this is due to three difficulties that additional data cannot fully resolve: (a) researchers lack experimental control, limiting their ability to draw causal inferences, and are largely inattentive to the standards for valid quasi-experimental design; (b) organizations are more appropriately construed as tools rather than as natural objects susceptible to ``laws;'' and (c) the regularities underlying organizational dynamics change over time such that empirical generalizations that are true during one period may be false in a different period. I conclude by suggesting improvements to research practice that would enable organization theory to progress toward greater insights.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of the study is to develop an integrated framework for managing project risks by analyzing risk across project, work package and activity levels, and developing responses. Design/methodology/approach The study first reviews the literature of various contemporary risk management frameworks in order to identify gaps in project risk management knowledge. Then it develops a conceptual risk management framework using combined analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and risk map for managing project risks. The proposed framework has then been applied to a 1500\&\#xa0;km oil pipeline construction project in India in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. The concerned project stakeholders were involved through focus group discussions for applying the proposed risk management framework in the project under study. Findings The combined AHP and risk map approach is very effective to manage project risks across project, work package and activity levels. The risk factors in project level are caused because of external forces such as business environment (e.g. customers, competitors, technological development, politics, socio-economic environment). The risk factors in work package and activity levels are operational in nature and created due to internal causes such as lack of material and labor productivity, implementation issues, team ineffectiveness, etc. Practical implications The suggested model can be applied to any complex project and helps manage risk throughout the project life cycle. Originality/value Both business and operational risks constitute project risks. In one hand, the conventional project risk management frameworks emphasize on managing business risks and often ignore operational risks. On the other hand, the studies that deal with operational risk often do not link them with business risks. However, they need to be addressed in an integrated way as there are a few risks that affect only the specific level. Hence, this study bridges the gaps.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) is the art and science of how work should be performed in an organization in order to ensure consistent outputs and to take advantage of improvement opportunities, e.g. reducing costs, execution times or error rates. Importantly, BPM is not about improving the way individual activities are performed, but rather about managing entire chains of events, activities and decisions that ultimately produce added value for an organization and its customers. This textbook encompasses the entire BPM lifecycle, from process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling, analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management, computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners and vendors worldwide.    In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 100 hands-on exercises \textendash{} many with solutions \textendash{} as well as numerous suggestions for further reading. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website fundamentals-of-bpm.org.},

  abstract = {Companies are increasingly embedded in B2B environments, where they have to collaborate in order to achieve their goals. Such collaborations lead to inter-organizational business processes that may be commonly supported through the exchange of electronic data interchange (EDI) messages (e.g., electronic purchase orders, invoices etc.). Despite the appearance of XML, traditional approaches to EDI, such as EDIFACT and ANSI X.12, still play an overwhelmingly dominant role. However, such traditional EDI standards lack a notion of process. In other words, the exchanged business documents are typically not embedded in the context of other exchanged business documents. This has two shortcomings: (1) the inability to apply proven business process management (BPM) methods, including process mining techniques, in such settings; and (2) the unavailability of systematic approaches to business intelligence (BI) using information from exchanged EDI messages. In this article, we present the EDImine Framework for enabling (1) the application of process mining techniques in the field of EDI-supported inter-organizational business processes, and (2) for supporting inter-organizational performance evaluation using business information from EDI messages, event logs and process models. As an enabling technology, we present a method for the semantic preprocessing of EDIFACT messages to exploit this potentially rich source of information by applying state of the art BPM and BI techniques. We show the applicability of our approach by means of a case study based on real-world EDI data of a German consumer goods manufacturing company.},

First, a non-customized process view is constructed from an internal structured process model by aggregating internal activities the provider wishes to hide. Second, a customized process view is constructed by hiding and omitting activities from the non-customized view that are not requested by the process consumer. The feasibility of the approach is shown by means of a case study.},

We provide details of some of our initial findings of the REA/TOA analysis which we carried out on the SAP Human Capital Management (HCM) module. Given that SAP is recognized as the dominant ERP system with over 50\% of the market share, this technology is viewed as the representative case study technology for exploring the theory of REA in actual ERP systems. In particular O'Leary's and Dunn et al.'s works are expanded upon, substantiating O'Leary's findings that SAP was found to be consistent with REA in its database, semantic and structure orientations. Using SAP's HCM module as the exemplar, two notable discoveries are made. These are namely (i) identifying that several anomalies exist in the underlying data model, and (ii) that there are many more REA entities than previously discovered by Dunn et al. Through the SAP HCM exemplar it is shown that REA adds value to modelling business processes in ERP systems.},

But the challenges of successful project financing are immense, and the requirements of the process can easily be misunderstood."

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} To explore the current literature base of critical success factors (CSFs) of ERP implementations, prepare a compilation, and identify any gaps that might exist. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Hundreds of journals were searched using key terms identified in a preliminary literature review. Successive rounds of article abstract reviews resulted in 45 articles being selected for the compilation. CSF constructs were then identified using content analysis methodology and an inductive coding technique. A subsequent critical analysis identified gaps in the literature base. Findings \textendash{} The most significant finding is the lack of research that has focused on the identification of CSFs from the perspectives of key stakeholders. Additionally, there appears to be much variance with respect to what exactly is encompassed by change management, one of the most widely cited CSFs, and little detail of specific implementation tactics. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} There is a need to focus future research efforts on the study of CSFs as they apply to the perspectives of key stakeholders and to ensure that this stakeholder approach is also comprehensive in its coverage of CSFs. As well, there is need to conduct more in-depth research into the concept of change management.

The first task is to get a technology project approved by business executives by demonstrating its potential payoff and keeping discussion focused on its business goals.  The second, most important, element to a project's success is the project manager, who should have more than just a couple of courses of project management and a reputation for being organized, according to Bob Wourms, director of outsourcing and professional staffing at the consultancy Project Management Solutions.  The third critical element is a skilled lead technologist, who can keep the programming on track and also oversee training for technical staffers who have moved on to the project in search of new challenges and skills.},

The sentiment (tone, opinion) is assessed using several categorization schemes in order to explore various aspects of language used in the annual reports of U.S. companies. Further, we employ machine learning methods and neural networks to predict financial performance expressed in terms of theZ-score bankruptcy model. Eleven categories of sentiment (ranging from negative and positive to active and common) are used as the inputs of the prediction models. Support vector machines provide the highest forecasting accuracy. This evidence suggests that there exist non-linear relationships between the sentiment and financial performance. The results indicate that the sentiment information is an important forecasting determinant of financial performance and, thus, can be used to support decision-making process of corporate stakeholders.

Thus, the EA approach would be significantly more promising if the data used when creating the models could be collected automatically\textemdash a topic not yet properly addressed by either academia or industry. This paper proposes network scanning for automatic data collection and uses an existing software tool for generating EA models (ArchiMate is employed as an example) based on the IT infrastructure of enterprises. While some manual effort is required to make the models fully useful to many practical scenarios (e.g., to detail the actual services provided by IT components), empirical results show that the methodology is accurate and (in its default state) require little effort to carry out.},

The study presented here analyzes the requirements specified in the guidelines of the Deutsche Bahn AG regarding the technical design of structures in railway construction and examines the feasibility of implementing these rules using BPMN and DMN. The rules analyzed are categorized into 12 different classes. Depending on the guideline subset, the BPMN/DMN approach was found to be useable in 37\%-75\% of the 943 rules examined. Considering only those rules that are relevant for the digital railway model, 68\% of the rules can be represented and automated using BPMN and DMN.},

While some authors have attributed large productivity improvements and substantial consumer benefits to IT, others report that IT has not had any bottom line impact on business profitability. This paper focuses on the fact that while productivity, consumer value, and business profitability are related, they are ultimately separate questions. Accordingly, the empirical results on IT value depend heavily on which question is being addressed and what data are being used. Applying methods based on economic theory, we are able to define and examine the relevant hypotheses for each of these three questions, using recent firm-level data on IT spending by 370 large firms. Our findings indicate that IT has increased productivity and created substantial value for consumers. However, we do not find evidence that these benefits have resulted in supranormal business profitability. We conclude that while modeling techniques need to be improved, these results are collectively consistent with economic theory. Thus, there is no inherent contradiction between increased productivity, increased consumer value, and unchanged business profitability.]}

We follow with a review of the literature, beginning with research examining the adoption and use of XBRL by capital market participants. Next, we discuss data quality concerns that may impact the use of XBRL data, followed by a discussion of how auditors use XBRL data and their potential role in the assurance of the data. We then present literature that uses meta and underlying XBRL data to examine financial statement characteristics and disclosure properties. Based on the review of the literature, we identify topics with the greatest potential for future research.}

We show how the system is applied to extract and transform related SAP transaction data for the ProM process mining tool.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several international studies have perceived the UK construction industry as less productive than those of the other progressive nations. Moreover, many UK construction clients have expressed dissatisfaction regarding the delivery of the completed projects, the quality of service and the predictability of cost. In order to address these problems, client-led innovation in construction projects has been emphasized by Sir Michael Latham's report Constructing the Team . The quality of the service that the client receives depends partly on the client's own involvement in the project. This will require the client to take a positive approach to promoting continuous improvement to all work situations. The traditional role of the client's representative varies from one of simply designing to the full monitoring of the project. It may also include project management activities such as planning, scheduling, coordinating and motivating. In total quality management (TQM) the administrative tasks of the client's representative include many aspects already addressed under traditional arrangements. However, current literature suggests that confusion exists over the involvement and participation of the client's representative when TQM is adopted in construction projects. To address this problem, research was conducted to identify the critical tasks for the client's representative to achieve total quality in construction. The findings also developed relevant best practices to be performed by the client's representative. This paper concentrates on the tasks of the client's representative, and assesses their importance in terms of improving quality in construction.

This figure for cost overrun is referred to frequently by scientific researchers, software process improvement consultants, and government advisors. In this paper, we review the validity of the Standish Group's 1994 cost overrun results. Our review is based on a comparison of the 189\% cost overrun figure with the cost overrun figures reported in other cost estimation surveys, and an examination of the Standish Group's survey design and analysis methods. We find that the figure reported by the Standish Group is much higher than those reported in similar estimation surveys and that there may be severe problems with the survey design and methods of analysis, e.g. the population sampling method may be strongly biased towards `failure projects'. We conclude that the figure of 189\% for cost overruns is probably much too high to represent typical software projects in the 1990s and that a continued use of that figure as a reference point for estimation accuracy may lead to poor decision making and hinder progress in estimation practices.},

  abstract = {Accountants have modeled and documented accounting information systems (AIS) through system flowcharts, which have also been used to study internal controls. However, when AIS are large, complex, and distributed, their system flowcharts are difficult to comprehend, challenging to use, and insufficient to support decision making in system design and implementation. In this primer we propose a set of requirements for modeling and documenting complex AIS that address those concerns. Since most other models such as SSAD, UML, and BPMN used to represent AIS are influenced by or can be reduced to Petri net models, we compare system flowcharts with Petri net representation of AIS. We evaluate systems flowcharts and Petri nets for their suitability in modeling AIS. We find that Petri nets are an attractive alternative due to their extensive capability to perform analytics and simulation. Analytics can be used to study structural and behavioral properties while simulations can help study run-time behavior of systems to evaluate computing capacity and system performance. We provide a detailed description and guidelines of how design analytics and implementation analytics can be achieved based on the Petri net framework. With this unified modeling strategy, we also describe how it can support the process of audit analytics. Petri nets are popular in computer science, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain management, and business process reengineering. We explore this viable method for rigorous study of AIS modeling and documentation.},

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of ``normal science,'' as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking's introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. ~Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.},

Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

Written by a best selling author with over 40 years of experiences in the construction and general contracting business, Construction Process Planning and Management provides you with the necessary tools to save time and money on your construction project. In this book, Sid Levy provides valuable advice for avoiding or working through the common problems that are a result of the long-term nature of construction projects, failure to select a?project delivery system? appropriate to the project, incomplete drawing and specifications, unrealistic scheduling, poor communication and coordination among participants, and inadequate contract administration. From project genesis, through design development to contractor and contract selection, on to construction oversight, punch list and successful project close-out, this book will point out those pitfalls to avoid and offer practical advice at every step along the way. Administer the general construction process including solicitation of contractor's qualifications (pre-qualify bidders), comparative analysis of bid packages, recommendation for contract award, contract document negotiation and documentation of job change orders. Provide Project Planning and on-site management and coordination of all construction projects. Ensure compliance of building construction rules and regulations and collaborate with chief engineers to monitor quality of construction. Conduct technical/plan review of construction documents and submit written responses identifying required corrections or changes.

  abstract = {Summary: The rate of failure of IT projects has remained little changed in survey after survey over the past 15-20 years-over 40-50\%. This has happened in spite of new technology, innovative methods and tools, and different management methods. Why does this happen? Why can't the situation be better? One reason is that many think of each IT effort as unique. In reality many IT projects are very similar at a high, strategic level. Where they differ is in the people and exact events-the detail. If you read the literature or have been in information systems or IT for some time, you have seen the same reasons for failure and the same problems and issues recur again and again. In this book IT Management experts Ben Lientz and Lee Larssen show you how to identify and track the recurring issues leading to failure in IT projects and provide a proven, modern method for addressing them. By following the recommendations in this books readers can significantly reduce the risk of IT failures and increase the rate of success. Benefits of using this approach: .Issues are identified earlier-giving more time for solution and action. .Issues are resolved more consistently since the approach tracks on their repetition. .You get an early warning of problems in IT work-before the budget or schedule fall apart. .Management tends to have more realistic expectations with an awareness of issues. .Users and managers have greater confidence in IT due to the improved handling of issues. .Since the number of issues tends to stabilize in an organization, the IT organization and management get better at detecting, preventing, and dealing with issues over time-cumulative improvement. .Giving attention to issues make users more realistic in their requests and acts to deter requirement changes and scope creep. * Full of checklists and methods that can be used in day to day Project Management work in real companies * Easy to read style and book organization allows the reader to jump into the book right at the point they need * Shows how to set up an issues database for better identification and tracking of issues, providing an Early Warning System to help move the project to success. Summary: The authors "show you how to identify and track the recurring issues leading to failure in IT projects, and [they] provide a proven, modern method for addressing them. By following the recommendations in this book, readers will significanctly reduce the risk of IT failures and increase the rate of success." [Back cover]. Part 1:Issues and Risk Management -- 1.

This paper surveys research on textual analysis of corporate disclosures, such as financial statements, earnings releases, and conference call transcripts. Specifically, the author focuses on research related to earnings quality, stock market efficiency, and corporate financial policies using the textual information in corporate disclosures. In this survey, he focuses on empirical large-sample textual analysis studies built upon the latest development in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and statistics. However, several challenges exist for researchers who want to advance this literature. First, much of the existing research has a strong methodology flavor. Second, like many other empirical studies in the accounting literature, the large-sample textual analysis literature also raises concerns about endogeneity. Third, for some studies especially for studies that attempt to measure managerial characteristics using the corporate filings, there could be some concerns about who actually writes the corporate disclosures.},

  abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore a case study example of the decision-making process that occurs within complex organizations. It exposes a murky "zone" of decision making and action between the strategic vision set by senior management and the work of teams to realise projects. Design/methodology/approach - A case study from the experience of one of the authors is used to illustrate the activities in this "zone". The lessons from the case study are supported by emerging project management and general management literature. The paper is exploratory in nature and the case study used provides a useful vehicle for reflection and sensemaking. Findings - The "zone" is metaphorically described as a highly complex and dynamic organism. Operating in the "zone" requires agility and an understanding of both the project and the organizational environment to cope with the demands of its chaotic nature. The paper's conclusions indicate that the traditional command-and-control management style is counter-productive in today's organizations. Research limitations/implications - Key implications include the need for project managers and their teams to be politically astute and sensitive to the needs and pressures of a wide range of project stakeholders. A methodology and tool for visualising the influence of stakeholders can be of considerable use and a flexible style of decision making is necessary to manage within the inherent uncertainty, complexity and chaos found in projects and organizations like the one illustrated by the case study. Originality/value - Shows that a paradigm shift in management thinking is needed to succeed in managing projects and their teams within the turbulent environment of a modern matrix organization.

Process mining uses such data to gain insights about the real execution of processes. In this thesis, we address research challenges in which a multi-perspective view on processes is needed and that look beyond the control-flow perspective, which defines the sequence of activities of a process. We consider problems in which multiple interacting process perspectives \textemdash{} in particular control-flow, data, resources, time, and functions \textemdash{} are considered together. The contributed methods span several types of process mining: two are concerned with conformance checking, two are process discovery techniques, and one is a decision mining method. All methods have been implemented, evaluated, and applied in the context of four case studies.},

The notion of collective competence is increasingly being seen as a vital precondition for the success of project teams, particularly in extreme environments. However, we still know little about the ingredients of this collective competence. To partially fill this gap, we make use of the insights offered by the very particular world of the French Special Forces, which have been operating successfully for several decades in extreme environments. Based on an in-depth qualitative study of their project-based mode of operations, we detail the six main ingredients of the collective competence that underpins the activities of commando units in the field and insist upon the criticality of the pre- and postmission phases during which this collective competence is actively reinforced.

We offer suggestions for how these assumptions can be updated to facilitate a convergent conversation between the two research streams.

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to discuss sound change order management practices and strategies to resolve change requests that occur during a construction project. Change in the construction industry is inevitable, and it occurs to some degree during almost every construction project. Changes may be minor, such as requesting additional money for the purchase of a valve. Or, changes may be complex, such as requesting millions of dollars for schedule delays and labor productivity losses. This article identifies six steps for the parties involved in a construction project to implement as part of change order management prior to the start of construction, during project execution, and if resolution regarding a change is not reached, through the negotiation process. Following these steps can help ensure that changes are managed efficiently and effectively, which, in turn, can lead to the overall success of a project.

  abstract = {Context Business process modeling is an essential part of understanding and redesigning the activities that a typical enterprise uses to achieve its business goals. The quality of a business process model has a significant impact on the development of any enterprise and IT support for that process. Objective Since the insights on what constitutes modeling quality are constantly evolving, it is unclear whether research on business process modeling quality already covers all major aspects of modeling quality. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the state of the art on business process modeling quality: What aspects of process modeling quality have been addressed until now and which gaps remain to be covered? Method We performed a systematic literature review of peer reviewed articles as published between 2000 and August 2013 on business process modeling quality. To analyze the contributions of the papers we use the Formal Concept Analysis technique. Results We found 72 studies addressing quality aspects of business process models. These studies were classified into different dimensions: addressed model quality type, research goal, research method, and type of research result. Our findings suggest that there is no generally accepted framework of model quality types. Most research focuses on empirical and pragmatic quality aspects, specifically with respect to improving the understandability or readability of models. Among the various research methods, experimentation is the most popular one. The results from published research most often take the form of intangible knowledge. Conclusion We believe there is a lack of an encompassing and generally accepted definition of business process modeling quality. This evidences the need for the development of a broader quality framework capable of dealing with the different aspects of business process modeling quality. Different dimensions of business process quality and of the process of modeling still require further research.},

BPMN offers a wide range of modeling constructs, significantly more than other popular languages. However, not all of these constructs are equally important in practice as business analysts frequently use arbitrary subsets of BPMN. In this paper we investigate what these subsets are, and how they differ between academic, consulting, and general use of the language. We analyzed 120 BPMN diagrams using mathematical and statistical techniques. Our findings indicate that BPMN is used in groups of several, well-defined construct clusters, but less than 20\% of its vocabulary is regularly used and some constructs did not occur in any of the models we analyzed. While the average model contains just 9 different BPMN constructs, models of this complexity have typically just 4-5 constructs in common, which means that only a small agreed subset of BPMN has emerged. Our findings have implications for the entire ecosystems of analysts and modelers in that they provide guidance on how to reduce language complexity, which should increase the ease and speed of process modeling.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management is considered an essential strategy to create and maintain competitive advantage by streamlining and monitoring corporate processes. While the identification of critical success factors for the management of business process related projects has been addressed by some research projects, the risks associated with these projects have received considerably less attention. This is a concern: Although BPM projects contain phases that relate to traditional software development and deployment projects, the application of risk mitigation strategies found in software engineering ignores the subsequent process management phases that follow upon the implementation and automation of processes. This paper provides an overview of risks associated with BPM projects along the phases of the BPM lifecycle. After a classification of the risks identified with individual lifecycle phases and transitions we discuss four strategies to deal with these risks: avoidance, mitigation, transfer, and acceptance. The outlook of this paper discusses how assessment frameworks such as CobIT and COSO can be applied to risk management in the context of BPM.},

  abstract = {The Design and Engineering Methodology for Organisations (DEMO) is a core method within the discipline of Enterprise Engineering (EE). It enables the creation of so-called essential models of enterprises. Such models are enterprise models that aim to focus on the organisational essence of an enterprise by leaving out (as much as possible) details of the socio-technical implementation. The organisational essence is then expressed primarily in terms of the actor roles involved, and the business transactions between these roles. The DEMO method has a firm theoretical foundation. At the same time, there is an increasing uptake of DEMO in practice. This also results in a need for enterprise-grade tool support for the use of the method. In this thesis, we report on a study concerning the selection, configuration, and extension, of an enterprise-grade tool to support the use of DEMO in practice with the need of the automatic verification and exchange of DEMO models. The configuration of the selected tool framework to support DEMO modelling, provided general insights regarding the development of enterprise-grade tool support for (model-driven) methods such as DEMO, while also providing feedback on the consistency and completeness of the DEMO Specification Language (DEMOSL); the specification language that accompanies the DEMO method.},

Case study reports on the successful use of agile practices in small distributed projects already exist. How these practices can be applied to larger projects, however, remains unstudied. This paper reports a case study on agile practices in a 40-person development organization distributed between Norway and Malaysia. Based on seven interviews in the development organization, we describe how scrum practices were successfully applied, e.g. using teleconferencing and web cameras for daily scrum meetings, synchronized 4-week sprints, weekly scrum-of-scrums, and Jira for backlog management. Non-scrum agile practices included nightly builds, automated testing, and team rooms. Supportig global software development practices, e.g. frequent visits, unofficial distributed meetings, domain expert networks, and annual gatherings are described. Positive experiences of using scrum included improved communication, trust and motivation, as well as better perceived quality. Challenges included misunderstood requirements, lack of videoconferencing possibilities, and awkward communication in distributed meetings due to cultural and geographical distance.

  abstract = {Why do some teams consistently deliver high performance while other, seemingly identical teams struggle? Led by Sandy Pentland, researchers at MIT's Human Dynamics Laboratory set out to solve that puzzle. Hoping to decode the "It factor" that made groups click, they equipped teams from a broad variety of projects and industries (comprising 2,500 individuals in total) with wearable electronic sensors that collected data on their social behavior for weeks at a time. With remarkable consistency, the data showed that the most important predictor of a team's success was its communication patterns. Those patterns were as significant as all other factors-intelligence, personality, talent-combined. In fact, the researchers could foretell which teams would outperform simply by looking at the data on their communication, without even meeting their members. In this article Pentland shares the secrets of his findings and shows how anyone can engineer a great team. He has identified three key communication dynamics that affect performance: energy,engagement, and exploration. Drawing from the data, he has precisely quantified the ideal team patterns for each. Even more significant, he has seen that when teams map their own communication behavior over time and then make adjustments that move it closer to the ideal, they can dramatically improve their performance.

This paper describes an environment for designing and validating conceptual business models using the model-driven architecture (MDA). The deliverable of the proposed modelling environment is an executable platform independent model (EPIM) that is further tested and validated through an MDA-based simulation feature. The proposed environment addresses a set of challenges associated with 1. shortcomings of the UML for being technically too complex for conceptual modelling goals as well as for being not precise enough  for rapid prototyping; 2. difficulties of MDE adoption due to the large set of required skills to adopt the key MDA standards such as the UML and XMI for developing and maintaining a requirements prototyping tools.

As with every type of conceptual model, a business process model has to meet certain syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic quality requirements to be of value. For many years, such quality aspects were investigated by centering on the properties of the model artifact itself. Only recently, the process of model creation is considered as a factor that influences the resulting model's quality. Our work contributes to this stream of research and presents an explorative analysis of the process of process modeling (PPM). We report on two large-scale modeling sessions involving 115 students. In these sessions, the act of model creation, i.e., the PPM, was automatically recorded. We conducted a cluster analysis on this data and identified three distinct styles of modeling. Further, we investigated how both task- and modeler-specific factors influence particular aspects of those modeling styles. Based thereupon, we propose a model that captures our insights. It lays the foundations for future research that may unveil how high-quality process models can be established through better modeling support and modeling instruction.},

  abstract = {Even though the implementation of different technological tools is already a trend, there are still aspects that should be refined so that companies' business processes can be improved. This is where social media comes to the foreground. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to study the evolution of research on social media implementation in the field of business process management. A systematic literature review was carried out following a search for and selection of articles that met our objective. To classify the sampled papers, we followed validated frameworks regarding social media management and business process management. Additionally, a detailed look at the sampled case studies was done to highlight companies' experiences in the field. Our final sample comprised 47 papers that simultaneously encompassed social media and business process management. The papers were classified according to their publishing frequency, the article type, both the topics and sectors to which they belonged, their methodological approaches, and the importance for business process management capability areas as well as capability subareas. Finally, word frequency queries were used to better understand diverse social media applications in business processes and to derive practical recommendations. The necessity for a multidisciplinary approach toward business processes was detected; therefore, topics, such as psychology, business economics, or information systems, were included, emphasizing innovation strategies, including gamification, big data, or crowdsourcing. Our most important recommendation concerns the evolution of business process management through different social media tools as a means to achieve a transition toward the recommended omnichannel management approach.},

Common BPMLs such as BPMN 2.0 or EPC are widely accepted and applied in various domains. However, such BPMLs provide a set of generic process modeling elements but do not allow for modeling domain specific concepts. This also holds true for control means as one of the key concepts for process audits. To address this gap, this paper presents an empirically grounded extension of the EPC with modeling concepts for process-integrated control means. The results of a laboratory experiment with 58 participants demonstrate that the extension facilitates a comprehensive enactment of process audits. In conclusion, the results of this research project are contrasted with a previously designed BPMN 2.0 extension in order to present insights we gain from extending two different BPMLs with the same domain concept.},

  abstract = {The real estate sector is often presented as an exemplary field that benefits from practical blockchain applications. The general hypothesis is that, in theory, blockchain could solve some significant challenges the real estate sector is facing, such as nontransparency, inefficiencies, fraud and corruption, high costs, and trust issues. However, the literature focuses on blockchain's theoretical benefits, challenges, or concepts. This research aims to understand the recent developments in the blockchain literature, specifically in the real estate sector, and to understand the current real-world applications by collecting empirical evidence from blockchain studies. The systematic literature review identified 262 relevant documents, after which a thematic content analysis was performed. Conceptual blockchain literature was identified to propose blockchain benefits for the real estate sector in four categories: land administration, real estate transactions, tokenization, and real estate management. The thematic content analysis also identified 26 empirical applications, of which all except one were related to land administration. Although the conceptual and theoretical blockchain literature presents blockchain as a disruptive and transformative technology for the real estate sector, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain adoption materializes more in hybrid, smaller-scale settings, where blockchain is merely an add-on layer to existing systems. Overall, most of the conceptual blockchain benefits remain empirically unconfirmed. On the other hand, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain could, for example, increase efficiency, reduce time, and provide verifiability, transparency, and automation, even in smaller-scale, hybrid settings. In addition, the applications indicate that blockchain could, in some cases, help reduce fraud and increase security and trust compared with centralized digital solutions. Finally, the empirical insights emphasize the role of political will, regulatory framework, availability of reliable digital data, public\textendash private partnerships, and educational aspects in blockchain applications.},

Seventy-three causes of delay were identified during the research. 76\% of the contractors and 56\% of the consultants indicated that average of time overrun is between 10\% and 30\% of the original duration. The most common cause of delay identified by all the three parties is ``change order''.

In this regard, implementing a set of control means and regularly auditing their effectiveness are suitable measures to ensure a compliant design and enactment of a business process. However, common business process modeling languages (PML) do not provide appropriate concepts to comprehensively model such control means. Not surprisingly, common PMLs are not widely used in the audit domain. To address this gap, this paper presents an extension of a PML with modeling concepts for process-integrated control means. As it is based on previous empirical research with auditors, the extension especially considers their requirements. The results of a laboratory experiment with 78 participants demonstrate that the extension supports auditors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of internal controls in a process model compared to current audit practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Risk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) has been addressed in research since more than a decade. However, the integration of the two independent research streams is still ongoing with a lack of research focusing on the conceptual modeling perspective. Such an integration results in an increased meta-model complexity and a higher entry barrier for modelers in creating conceptual models and for addressees of the models in comprehending them. Multi-view modeling can reduce this complexity by providing multiple interdependent viewpoints that, all together, represent a complex system. Each viewpoint only covers those concepts that are necessary to separate the different concerns of stakeholders. However, adopting multi-view modeling discloses a number of challenges particularly related to managing consistency which is threatened by semantic and syntactic overlaps between the viewpoints. Moreover, usability and efficiency of multi-view modeling have never been systematically evaluated. This paper reports on the conceptualization, implementation, and empirical evaluation of e-BPRIM, a multi-view modeling extension of the Business Process-Risk Management-Integrated Method (BPRIM). The findings of our research contribute to theory by showing, that multi-view modeling outperforms diagram-oriented modeling by means of usability and efficiency of modeling, and quality of models. Moreover, the developed modeling tool is openly available, allowing its adoption and use in R-BPM practice. Eventually, the detailed presentation of the conceptualization serves as a blueprint for other researchers aiming to harness multi-view modeling.},

To achieve this we will take a stepwise approach: identify the key concepts as used in different methods, map their constructs, derive transformations, create their syntax and semantics, and develop requirements specifications on which a tool can be based. For Conceptual modeling we use Object-role modeling (ORM), a fact-oriented approach for modeling information at a conceptual level. For process modeling we use a technique (workflow language) called Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL). YAWL works as an extension of Petri Nets with constructs to address the multiple instances, advanced synchronization and cancellation patterns. This research is under the supervision of Dr. S.J.B.A (Stijn) Hoppenbrouwers, Dr.(Patrick) van Bommel and Prof. Dr. H.A. (Erik) Proper.},

The BPM discipline develops methods, techniques, and tools to support the design, enactment, management, and analysis of operational business processes. Mainstream business process modeling notations and workflow management systems are using token-based semantics borrowed from Petri nets. Moreover, state-of-the-art BPM analysis techniques are using Petri nets as an internal representation. Users of BPM methods and tools are often not aware of this.

For example, the event log can be replayed on top of the process model to find undesirable deviations suggesting fraud or inefficiencies. Moreover, conformance checking techniques can also be used for measuring the performance of process discovery algorithms and to repair models that are not aligned well with reality.},

For example, one can adopt various data mining approaches to measure the quality of the discovered or enhanced process models.

  abstract = {Process mining provides the technology to leverage the ever-increasing amounts of event data in modern organizations and societies. Despite the growing capabilities of modern computing infrastructures, event logs may be too large or too complex to be handled using conventional approaches. This chapter focuses on handling ``Big Event Data'' and relates process mining to Big Data technologies. Moreover, it is shown that process mining problems can be decomposed in two ways, case-based decomposition and activity-based decomposition. Many of the analysis techniques described can be made scalable using such decompositions. Also other performance-related topics such as streaming process mining and process cubes are discussed. The chapter shows that the lion's share of process mining techniques can be ``applied in the large'' by using the right infrastructure and approach.},

These techniques provide new means to discover, monitor, and improve processes in a variety of application domains. There are two main drivers for the growing interest in process mining. On the one hand, more and more events are being recorded, thus, providing detailed information about the history of processes. On the other hand, there is a need to improve and support business processes in competitive and rapidly changing environments. This manifesto is created by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining and aims to promote the topic of process mining. Moreover, by defining a set of guiding principles and listing important challenges, this manifesto hopes to serve as a guide for software developers, scientists, consultants, business managers, and end-users. The goal is to increase the maturity of process mining as a new tool to improve the (re)design, control, and support of operational business processes.},

Mainstream data mining and machine learning tools provide more sophisticated forms of analysis, but are also not tailored towards the analysis and improvement of processes. Fortunately, there are dedicated process mining tools able to transform event data into actionable process-related insights. For example, ProM is an open-source process mining tool supporting all of the techniques mentioned in this book. Process discovery, conformance checking, social network analysis, organizational mining, clustering, decision mining, prediction, and recommendation are all supported by ProM plug-ins. However, the usability of the hundreds of available plug-ins varies and the complexity of the tool may be overwhelming for end-users. In recent years, several vendors released dedicated process mining tools (e.g., Celonis, Disco, EDS, Fujitsu, Minit, myInvenio, Perceptive, PPM, QPR, Rialto, and SNP). These tools typically provide less functionality than ProM, but are easier to use while focusing on data extraction, performance analysis and scalability. This chapter provides an overview of available tools and trends.},

Researchers have used various maturity models to investigate the development of a business process orientation (BPO), and most have argued that such development comes in stages. Current literature underestimates the interrelationships between BPO capabilities and fails to consider multidimensional or non-linear paths to maturity. To refine the features of maturity models, we rely on configuration theory to uncover different archetypes for BPO development and quantitatively evaluate them by examining performance differences among archetypes based on a large-scale international dataset. The resulting empirical taxonomy with seven BPO archetypes establishes important performance differences between organizations at a similar maturity level. Besides strengthening the theoretical foundations of BPO and making maturity assessments more multifaceted, our results help organizations focus their managerial efforts by enabling comparison with peers in the same archetype and showing various paths for BPO improvement.},

The resulting definition ``Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks'' helps the scientific community, the business world, political actors, and citizens to have a common and clear understanding about what Open Science is, and stimulates an open debate about the social, economic, and human added value of this phenomenon.},

Two cases of premature project closure are analysed in different contexts: in the car industry and the aircraft manufacturing industry. The key findings concern the managerial challenges that are present in premature project closures: the need for involvement of senior and also project managers, the need to understand the often changed role of internal and external project stakeholders, and the need to understand that the `future matters' in premature project closure.},

Process science is based on four key principles; it (1) puts processes at the center of attention, (2) investigates processes scientifically, (3) embraces perspectives of multiple disciplines, and (4) aims to create impact by actively shaping the unfolding of processes. The ubiquitous availability of digital trace data, combined with advanced data analytics capabilities, offer new and unprecedented opportunities to study processes through multiple data sources, which makes process science very timely.},

Digital transformation has been defined as the use of new digital technologies, such as mobile, artificial intelligence, cloud, blockchain, and the Internet of things (IoT) technologies, to enable major business improvements to augment customer experience, streamline operations, or create new business models. In making sense of digital transformation, we discovered that leaders in various industry circles use the term inconsistently to describe various strategizing and organizing activities; in addition, the term has gained limited scholarly attention as a context for study of strategic change. Drawing on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects at incumbent firms, we propose a process model comprising of nine microfoundations to reveal the generic contingency factors that trigger, enable, and hinder the building of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Our findings reveal that digital transformation is an ongoing process of using new digital technologies in everyday organizational life, which recognizes agility as the core mechanism for the strategic renewal of an organization's (1) business model, (2) collaborative approach, and eventually the (3) culture.},

  abstract = {Current auditing procedures struggle with the incorporation of new data-driven techniques such as Process Mining. Although Process Mining has been applied experimentally on micro-level workflow processes, it is not so easy to apply on the level of the value cycle that is at the core of accounting databases. A more general problem is that the new smart approaches lack a well-developed accounting ontology. The REA business ontology does offer such an ontology but so far, its main focus has been on accounting database design. In this paper, a Petri Net specification of REA is proposed for ontologybased process analysis. This specification makes it possible to express more than the traditional static specification. The paper also describes how REA Petri Nets can be developed using Process Mining and how they can be applied in a Continuous Auditing framework.},

  abstract = {A lean-agile model of homebuilders' production systems is proposed in this research. Value stream mapping is utilized to clarify the proposed lean-agile model, in which pull and Kanban are used to ensure smooth production upstream of the de-coupling point, while fluctuating market demands in terms of variety of homes and variability of volumes are managed by the agile process downstream of the de-coupling point. The de-coupling point is used to provide components to downstream agile process and shield upstream smooth production from market fluctuations. A simulation model is developed to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed lean-agile model. Simulation experiments show that the lean-agile model prevents the accumulation of high inventory levels and thus provides better customization opportunities for clients compared to even-flow-construction. It also provides a more stable process with shorter cycle times compared to sales-driven production. The proposed lean-agile model offers new possibilities for homebuilders to manage the balance between meeting fluctuating market demands and stabilizing the production system.

The availability of digital data opens up new opportunities for innovative audit procedures. Process mining can be used as a novel data analysis technique to support auditors in this context. Process mining algorithms produce process models by analyzing recorded event logs. Contemporary general purpose mining algorithms commonly use the temporal order of recorded events for determining the control flow in mined process models. The presented research shows how data dependencies related to the accounting structure of recorded events can be used as an alternative to the temporal order of events for discovering the control flow. The generated models provide accurate information on the control flow from an accounting perspective and show a lower complexity compared to those generated using timestamp dependencies. The presented research follows a design science research approach and uses three different real world data sets for evaluation purposes.},

The semantics of this financial services regulations controlled natural language (FSRCNL) can produce compliance checks that analyse both the promised model and/or monitor the application itself after it is deployed.},

  abstract = {Context Large organizations often run hundreds or even thousands of different business processes. Managing such large collections of business process models is a challenging task. Software can assist in performing that task, by supporting common management functions such as storage, search and version management of models. It can also provide advanced functions that are specific for managing collections of process models, such as managing the consistency of public and private processes. Software that supports the management of large collections of business process models is called: business process model repository software. Objective This paper contributes to the development of business process model repositories, by analyzing the state of the art. Method To perform the analysis a literature survey and a comparison of existing (business process model) repository technology is performed. Result The results of the state of the art analysis are twofold. First, a framework for business process model repositories is presented, which consists of a management model and a reference architecture. The management model lists the functionality that can be provided and the reference architecture presents the components that provide that functionality. Second, an analysis is presented of the extent to which existing business process model repositories implement the functionality from the framework. Conclusion The results presented in the paper are valuable as a comprehensive overview of business process model repository functionality. In addition they form a basis for a future research agenda. We conclude that existing repositories focus on traditional functionality rather than exploiting the full potential of information management tools, thus we show that there is a strong basis for further research.},

  abstract = {Regulations provide the legal basis for good manufacturing practices in the food industry. They define a common terminology and the requirements for improving food quality and safety, which are highly important in light of past and current food scandals. However, the rules that can be derived from regulations are scattered in legal texts that have to be processed manually to create a set of company-specific process controls. Current approaches lack an intermediate, domain-specific representation that fosters reuse and is technology-agnostic. In this paper, such a pattern-based approach is developed to formalize compliance requirements in the food industry. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it presents a pattern catalogue that is built on the basis of real-world legal documents. Second, it devises a transformation process that allows users to systematically capture compliance requirements from textual descriptions, to represent them in the form of patterns and, finally, to transform them into executable process controls.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Many researchers and practitioners suggest a contingent instead of a ``one size fits all'' approach in business process management (BPM). The purpose of this paper is to offer a contingency theory of BPM, which proposes contingency factors relevant to the successful management of business processes and that explains how and why these contingencies impact the relationships between process management and performance.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The authors develop the theory by drawing on organizational information processing theory (OIPT) and applying an information processing (IP) perspective to the process level.                                         Findings               The premise of the model is that the process management mechanisms such as documentation, standardization or monitoring must compensate for the uncertainty and equivocality of the nature of the process that has to be managed. In turn, managing through successful adaptation is a prerequisite for process performance.                                         Research limitations/implications               The theory provides a set of testable propositions that specify the relationship between process management mechanisms and process performance. The authors also discuss implications of the new theory for further theorizing and outline empirical research strategies that can be followed to enact, evaluate and extend the theory.                                         Practical implications               The theory developed in this paper allows an alternative way to describe organizational processes and supports the derivation of context-sensitive management approaches for process documentation, standardization, monitoring, execution and coordination.                                         Originality/value               The theoretical model is novel in that it provides a contextualized view on BPM that acknowledges different types of processes and suggests different mechanisms for managing these. The authors hope the paper serves as inspiration both for further theory development as well as to empirical studies that test, refute, support or otherwise augment the arguments.},
