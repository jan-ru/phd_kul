## [27-05-2023] Tools

(https://pypi.org/project/refextract/)

(https://docs.readme.com/rdmd/docs/getting-started)


ORCID toegevoegd aan de authors index using the latex package "orcidlink".

Idea for backlog: obtain keywords via orcid api (python) and build wordcloud.

## [26-05-2024 / day08] Include Academicons

[quarto extention](https://schochastics.quarto.pub/academicons-quarto-extension/)

Potentially add google scholar link to author index

{{< ai google-scholar size=lg >}}

Possibly also use [fontawesome computer icons](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome5_icons_computers.asp)

Look into [interactive-sql](https://shafayetshafee.github.io/interactive-sql/example.html) which may help to clarify relationships between accounts and "verdichtingen".
Note that interactive-sql is a wrapper aroung [sqlime](https://sqlime.org/about.html).


## Document attributes

Current thinking: use latex package

* \totcounter
* \regtotcounter{table}
* \regtotcounter{figure}


In case of output to html, and not to loose functionality of certain latex packages (such as orcid):

* Document is processed and variables obtain a number.
* Intermediary file is saved.
* Variables are read [ref. texexchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/321346/how-to-read-a-variable-from-a-file-in-latex)
* html snippet creation [html snippet](https://texfaq.org/FAQ-LaTeX2HTML)
* html snippet is included in header, footer, or body of file
