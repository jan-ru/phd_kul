    "text": "From a podcast by (ThisIsResearch?), I understand in the field of IS research there is a “basket of 8” authoritative journals (table 1). The columns: level, impact factor (IF), Association of Business Schools (ABS), Harzing are taken from the Vlerick Strategic Journal List (the List),effective as of January 2020. Empty means the journal is not on the List.\n\n\n\nTable C.1: Basket of 8\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Title\nLevel\nIF\n\n\n\n\nMIS Quarterly (MISQ)\nA*\n7,268\n\n\nJournal of Management Information Systems (JMIS)\nA*\n2,744\n\n\nInformation Systems Journal (ISJ)\nA\n4,267\n\n\nJournal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS)\nA\n2,839\n\n\nCommunications of the Association for Information Systems (CAIS)\nA\n?\n\n\nInformation Systems Research (ISR)\nA*\n2,301\n\n\nJournal of Information Technology (JIT)\nA\n4,435\n\n\nEuropean Journal of Information Systems (EJIS)\nA\n2,819\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list of 8 premier journals exists since 2011. The list has been updated in 2023 to include an additional 3 journals.\n\n\n\nTable C.2: Recent additions\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Title\nLevel\nIF\n\n\n\n\nDecision Support Systems (DSS)\nA\n2,819\n\n\nInformation & Management (IAM)\nA\n3,890\n\n\nInformation and Organization (IAO)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext to the basket of 8 (now 11) there are other journals that I will want to search articles from. BISE is of interest because it is an european (IS) journal (as is EJIS). BPMJ and IJDG may be of interest given the subject matter their titles refer to. SMR I find of interest as it focusses on the intersection of Management and Technology. On the topic of work design and agility I may want to reference works of Nelson Repenning. HBR maybe of interest for the (historic) articles on business process reengineering by Michael Hammer.\n\n\n\nTable C.3: Other journals of interest\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Title\nLevel\nIF\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Process Management Journal (BPMJ)\n\n\n\n\nBusiness & Information Systems Engineering (BISE)\n\n\n\n\nJournal of Disclosure and Governance (IJDG)\n\n\n\n\nSloan Management Review (SMR)\nA*\n0,971\n\n\nHarvard Business Review (HBR)\nA*\n0,720\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of “where does one aim to be published”, for an entirely different type of journal:\n\n\n\nTable C.4: Yet other journals of interest\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Title\nLevel\nIF\n\n\n\n\nJournal of Open Source Software (JOSS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOSS doesn’t show on any of the quality journal lists. Yet, it seems an appropriate outlet for part of the work produced in the context of my PhD research. My research follows a design science methodology. “In order to add science to Design Science, developed artifacts need to be properly evaluated” (Mijač 2019).\nIt is important to define the field the research is positioned in: I still will look into “business informatics”. This is a term less used in the U.S. and more used in the E.U.

Conformance can be viewed as a proactive approach to quality management, where the focus is on preventing defects and errors from occurring in the first place.\nConformance often involves the use of quality management systems, such as ISO 9001, which provide a framework for organizations to establish and maintain a culture of quality.
