Was Lu a PhD student with Governatori?\nTo find the number of publications they both worked on I may want to look into bibliometrix: a R tool for comprehensive bibliometric analysis of scientific literature. This is in R, there maybe similar tools for Python. Pybibliometrics  looks to be an interface to Elsevier Scopus only."

    "text": "[05/07/2023] Looking in my Zotero library for articles with a title that contains “systematic literature review”, the result is 7 hits.\nThe first is Kitchenham and Charters (2007) and there is a duplicate Keele (2007). Second there are 3 SLR’s where Van Looy is co-author (Moreno-Montes de Oca et al. (2015), Ahmad and Van Looy (2020), Prodanova and Van Looy (2019)). There is 1 SLR about BPMN extentions (Zarour et al. (2019)) Finally, there is one SLR about Open Science (Vicente-Saez and Martinez-Fuentes (2018)) which is not relevant to BP4RC.\n** How to reference multiple papers? **\nTo be included for the meeting with the promotors early September: * Specification of the research questions * Development of a review protocol\nSearch strings\nI want to expand the number of SLR to 10 by including SLR’s from A-star journals in the BPM/IS field(s).\nTo demonstrate International Research Collaboration (IRC), “using affiliations listed in publications has become the standard practice” . I would like to use this to show the affiliations of the authors of the articles included in my literature research.\nConcepts mentioned in the article: - Data quality (DQ) and Data quality assessment (DQA) - Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) - Zotero Data quality dimensions (DQDs)\nIn the article above DQ is split into: - Intrinsic Data Quality (4 attributes) - Contextual Data Quality (5 attributes) - Representational Data Quality (4 attributes) - Accessibility Data Quality (2 attributes)\nNote: in this study Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) is one of the four datasources considered.

    "text": "(Moreno-Montes de Oca et al. 2015)\nThe above mentioned aspects provide indications that the field of modeling quality still needs to gain in maturity. Based on our interpretation of the SLR results, we suggest further research on developing a more comprehensive quality framework, on investigating the knowledge and development layer, and on the process of modeling itself. From our study, it has become clear that there are plenty of open research questions in the area of business process modeling quality that seems worthwhile to pursue, both from an academic and a practical perspective.\n(Zarour et al. 2019) :\nFor future work, we plan to strengthen this literature review by taking into account other evaluation criteria and by covering more literature such as extensions not written in English and those proposed in master and doctoral theses. We also envisage to conduct a literature review on existing DSMLs and the extension of other BP-related languages like BPEL and UML. Finally, another literature review on BPMN extensions should be performed in the coming years in order to see the evolution of BPMN extension features.\n\n\n\n\nMoreno-Montes de Oca, Isel, Monique Snoeck, Hajo A.
