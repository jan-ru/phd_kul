  abstract = {Conceptual Business Process Modelling Languages (BPMLs) express certain aspects of processes (e.g. activities, roles, interactions, data, etc.) and address different application areas. To evaluate BPMLs, a general framework is required. Although a lot of BPMLs are available in research and industry, an established evaluation framework as well as a comprehensive evaluation of BPMLs is missing. To bridge this gap, we propose a generic meta-model that captures a wide range of process concepts and evaluate seven BPMLs based on this meta-model.},

  abstract = {Spreadsheets contain a huge amount of high-value data but do not observe a standard data model and thus are difficult to integrate. A large number of data integration tools exist, but they generally can only work on relational data. Existing systems for extracting relational data from spreadsheets are too labor intensive to support ad-hoc integration tasks, in which the correct extraction target is only learned during the course of user interaction.This paper introduces a system that automatically extracts relational data from spreadsheets, thereby enabling relational spreadsheet integration. The resulting integrated relational data can be queried directly or can be translated into RDF triples. When compared to standard techniques for spreadsheet data extraction on a set of 100 random Web spreadsheets, the system reduces the amount of human labor by 72\% to 92\%. In addition to the system design, we present the results of a general survey of more than 400,000 spreadsheets we downloaded from the Web, giving a novel view of how users organize their data in spreadsheets.},

  abstract = {Project Risk Registers have been used extensively for many years. However, they do not account for the interaction between risks, for example, the occurrence of one risk exacerbating other risks or portfolios of risks being more significant than the sum of the individual risks. This leads to the need to consider `risk systemicity' as a part of risk analysis. This paper reports on a specific case for a large multinational project based organization, one that the authors had been involved with in the analysis of a number of projects that had massive cost overruns. Following these analyses the organization was persuaded of the importance of risk systemicity. The organization therefore engaged the authors to develop a `Risk Filter'. This filter is a tool for identifying areas of risk exposure on future projects and creating a framework for their investigation. The `Risk Filter' is now used on all projects ever since its introduction; by the end of May 2003 it had been used by nine divisions, on over 60 major projects, and completed by 450 respondents. It is also used at several stages during the life of a project to aid in the risk assessment and management of each project, and contributes to a project database.

They are heavily regulated and there have been a significant number of well publicized compliance failings in recent years. This is despite Business Process Compliance (BPC) being both a well researched domain in academia and one where significant progress has been made. This study seeks to determine why Australian banks find BPC so challenging. We interviewed 22 senior managers from a range of functions within the four major Australian banks to identify the key challenges. Not every process in every bank is facing the same issues, but in processes where a bank is particularly challenged to meet its compliance requirements, the same themes emerge. The compliance requirement load they bear is excessive, dynamic and complex. Fulfilling these requirements relies on impenetrable spaghetti processes, and the case for sustainable change remains elusive, locking banks into a fail-fix cycle that increases the underlying complexity. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that identifies and aggregates the challenges, and a circuit-breaker approach as an ``off ramp'' to the fail-fix cycle.},

The popularity of the concept has led to an explosion of TQM-related literature. A careful review of the literature suggests that most publications recount the experiences or perceptions of the authors or deal with single case organisations. Furthermore, there is a dearth of empirical research and literature dealing with TQM's implementation process. This paper reports the findings of a research project that empirically examined the process of TQM implementation in a sample of organisations widely regarded as leading exponents of TQM. The paper presents a non-prescriptive model of the TQM implementation process derived from the findings and proposes an ``outcome driven'' approach as an alternative to the more commonplace TQM implementation strategies.},

However, to exploit the full benefits of new IT, it is essential to reveal BPM's research potential and to detect recent trends in practice. Therefore, this work presents a systematic literature review (SLR) with 231 recent academic articles (from 2014 until May 2019) that integrate BPM with digital innovations (DI). We position those articles against seven future BPM-DI trends that were inductively derived from an expert panel. By complementing the expected trends in practice with a state-of-the-art literature review, we are able to derive covered and uncovered themes in order to help bridge a rigor-relevance gap. The major technological impacts within the BPM field seem to focus on value creation, customer engagement and managing human-centric and knowledge-intensive business processes. Finally, our findings are categorized into specific calls for research and for action to let scholars and organizations better prepare for future digital needs.},

We theorize how the ongoing technological developments reinforce the traditional functions of data as instruments of management and control but also reframe and extend their role. By rendering data as technical entities, digital technologies transform the process of knowing and the knowledge functions data fulfil in socioeconomic life. These functions are most of the times mediated by putting together disperse and steadily updatable data in more stable entities we refer to as data objects. Users, customers, products, physical machines rendered as data objects become the technical and cognitive means through which organizational knowledge, patterns and practices develop. Such conditions loosen the dependence of data from domain knowledge, reorder the relative significance of internal versus external references in organizations, and contribute to a paradigmatic contemporary development that we identify with the decentering of organizations of which digital platforms are an important specimen.},

Contrary to prior research, results indicate the level of risk from inadequate communication is not significantly greater when team members are not grouped in one location. Further, despite increased dependence of virtual teams on technology for communication, there was no evidence of significantly more project risk due to technological failure. However, virtual team projects exhibited notably more risk due to insufficient knowledge transfer. A plausible explanation is decreased implicit or informal knowledge transfer in virtual environments. We conclude that the possibility of insufficient knowledge transfer should be included in virtual project risk management plans, and consideration should be given in such projects to the extent to which knowledge that is traditionally shared implicitly might be shared explicitly through electronic means.},

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

Ook komen ervaringen uit de praktijk aan bod. Kijk hier het webinar terug {$>$} De overheid zet bij de uitvoering van wetgeving op grote schaal ICTvoorzieningen in. Dat maakt het mogelijk om snel besluiten te nemen over rechten en plichten van burgers en bedrijven, maar ook om dienstverlening op maat te bieden. Een goede vertaling van wetgeving naar de digitale uitvoeringspraktijk vergt precisie bij de interpretatie van wetgeving en bij de vastlegging van de betekenis en structuur ervan. Multidisciplinaire en iteratieve samenwerking tussen juristen, uitvoeringsdeskundigen, kennismodelleurs en softwareontwikkelaars is daarbij essentieel. Dit slaat een brug tussen taal en techniek en draagt eraan bij dat de regels letterlijk goed terechtkomen in de systemen. Ook zorgt het ervoor dat besluiten die op basis daarvan genomen worden, uitgelegd en verantwoord kunnen worden. Dit boek beschrijft een aanpak voor Wetsanalyse die ondersteuning biedt bij de interpretatie van wetgeving voor een effectieve en uitlegbare digitale toepassing van wetgeving n bij de samenwerking tussen de daarbij betrokken disciplines. Daarnaast laat het de concrete toepassing van Wetsanalyse zien in twee verschillende wetgevingsdomeinen: de Zorgverzekeringswet en de Algemene wet bestuursrecht},

Based on the data collected from 204 medium- to high-level business executives in various industries, the results of this empirical study indicate that the adoption of BA positively influences BPER. There is also positive relationship between BPER and FP. Finally, the results show that BPER fully mediates the relationship between BA adoption and FP.},

We claim that BPM should shift to a `holistic' BPM approach, where organizational processes are well integrated, all BPM efforts are effectively coordinated, and BPM is well linked with other management practices.

  abstract = {The ``expectations gap'' refers to differences in views of auditors and users regarding the extent of assurance obtained from auditing procedures. One aspect of the expectations gap considered by prior research is whether users differentiate the level of assurance provided by different audit procedures. We extend that research by studying whether investors understand that information outside of the financial statements, in the 10-K as well as on corporate websites, is not audited. This research is important, as the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board currently is considering proposals aimed at clarifying or expanding the auditor's responsibility for that information. We surveyed professional and nonprofessional investors, and find that professionals are more likely than nonprofessionals to correctly identify which 10-K components are audited. However, many investors in both groups believe that information outside of the financial statements is audited when in fact it is not. We also find some evidence that investors use certain information categories more often when they believe that the information is audited. Also, for both investor groups, responses concerning whether currently unaudited information categories should be audited suggest an unmet demand for greater assurance on information outside of the financial statements. Our results support proposals for greater clarity in the audit opinion concerning the nature of procedures performed on information outside of the financial statements. Further, our findings imply that additional assurance on that information might be considered useful.},

As a result, only a fraction of time is spent actually applying techniques to discover, control and predict the business process. Moreover, current process mining techniques assume a single case notion. However, in reallife processes often different case notions are intertwined. For example, events of the same order handling process may refer to customers, orders, order lines, deliveries, and payments. Therefore, we propose to use Multiple Viewpoint (MVP) models that relate events through objects and that relate activities through classes. The required event data are much closer to existing relational databases. MVP models provide a holistic view on the process, but also allow for the extraction of classical event logs using different viewpoints. This way existing process mining techniques can be used for each viewpoint without the need for new data extractions and transformations. We provide a toolchain allowing for the discovery of MVP models (annotated with performance and frequency information) from relational databases. Moreover, we demonstrate that classical process mining techniques can be applied to any selected viewpoint.},

However, through his extensive writings covering more than six decades, Juran has managed to distill and synthesize the subject. He has provided us with a coherent framework and terminology and anticipated many of the principles that subsequently became incorporated under the Six Sigma umbrella. We briefly outline Juran's framework and discuss a number of key contributions he has made to the subject of managing for quality.

From the paper, readers in the scientific community are expected to extract all the relevant information necessary to reproduce and validate the results presented by the paper's authors. However, the increased use of computer software in science makes reproducing scientific results increasingly difficult. The research paper in its current state is no longer sufficient to fully reproduce, validate, or review a paper's experimental results and conclusions. This impedes scientific progress. To remedy these concerns, we introduce Paper Ma{\textasciicircum}che{\textasciiacute}, a new system for creating dynamic, executable research papers. The key novelty of Paper Ma{\textasciicircum}ch{\textasciiacute}e is its use of virtual machines, which lets readers and reviewers easily view and interact with a paper, and reproduce key experimental results. For authors, the Paper Ma{\textasciicircum}che{\textasciiacute} workbench provides an easy-touse interface to build an executable paper. By transforming the static research paper into a dynamic and interactive entity, Paper Ma{\textasciicircum}che{\textasciiacute} brings the presentation of scientific results into the 21st century. We believe that Paper Ma{\textasciicircum}che{\textasciiacute} will become indispensable to the scientific process, and increase the visibility of key findings among members and non-members of the scientific community.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) has proven successful to help organizations improve and innovate, and its application has grown in scope and context. One essential problem related to this development is that the BPM body of knowledge does not account for a broader variety of business contexts. On the contrary, most approaches, methods, or models in BPM suggest one way forward, and we recognize that BPM projects following a one-size-fits-all approach are prone to fail, since they do not sufficiently consider situational requirements. In this viewpoint article, we argue that BPM needs to be contextual in order for projects to be most efficient and effective. We observe a lack of research on how to identify and characterize business contexts relevant for tailoring the right BPM approach. Therefore, we examine contextual factors that influence BPM and propose a framework to identify the context in which BPM is applied. We define context in BPM as situational factors related to goal-, process-, organization-, and environment-dimensions. Our viewpoint article not only creates awareness for contextual BPM, it also intends to stimulate research on the role of context in BPM and to help practitioners better understand the specific business context in which BPM initiatives are applied.},

We propose the construction of a taxonomy that can be straightforwardly embedded in the capital framework of banks, insurers and other regulated financial institutions around the world. The approach presented builds on approaches commonly adopted by banks and provides a prudential means to identify and capitalise the relevant risks. We highlight the dangers of potential miss-pricing of risk that could occur under a pure green-taxonomy if risk weights are reduced for assets deemed ''green''. Furthermore we investigate a number of the risks namely asset values (equity) and credit risks for European electrical utility companies and highlight how financial organisations would be able to capture the risks within their current framework. The approach utilises a long term simulation framework from an integrated assessment model that drives company investment choices over the simulation horizon. This approach gives rise to estimates of equity valuation, bond prices, credit ratings and default probabilities that can be used to assess long term credit exposures or potential shifts in current market valuation.},

The disclosure model developed is based on the main headings specified in the Fourth and Seventh European Union Directives. Based on this model, disclosure by U.K. companies is more comprehensive than by Dutch corporations and the difference is significant (5 percent level with two-tailed test). Most of the key areas of disclosure are found to be more comprehensive in the U.K. than in The Netherlands. This is due to more stringent regulation in the U.K. than in The Netherlands where the approach is more flexible. The model is used to establish whether disclosure is related to a number of firm-specific characteristics using regression analysis. The impact of size is the same for both countries, but other firm-specific characteristics have different effects.},

Automating the process of creating these reports, even partially has the potential to save a company time and resources that could be spent on more creative tasks. Some software exists which uses conditional statements and sentence templates to generate the written sections. This solution lacks creativity and innovation when compared to recent advancements in NLP and deep learning. We instead implement a transformer network to solve the task of generating this text. By generating matching pairs between tables and sentences found in financial documents, we created a dataset for our transformer. We were able to achieve promising results, with the final model reaching a BLEU score of 63.3. Generated sentences are natural, grammatically correct and mostly faithful to the information found in the tables.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the prospects for cumulative theory development in organization theory. Organization theory generally takes organizations (business corporations, nonprofits, hospitals, universities, etc.) as discrete and meaningful units of analysis. The revolution in information and communication technologies (ICTs) over the past two decades has made comprehensive time-series data on millions of organizations widely available to scholars around the world. Yet, it is not obvious that organization theory has become more precise, more general, or more accurate as a result. The author argues that this is due to three difficulties that additional data cannot fully resolve: (a) researchers lack experimental control, limiting their ability to draw causal inferences, and are largely inattentive to the standards for valid quasi-experimental design; (b) organizations are more appropriately construed as tools rather than as natural objects susceptible to ``laws;'' and (c) the regularities underlying organizational dynamics change over time such that empirical generalizations that are true during one period may be false in a different period. I conclude by suggesting improvements to research practice that would enable organization theory to progress toward greater insights.},

To capture these business rules, organizations can choose between a multitude of commercially and scientifically available business rule languages. However, current languages are not precise enough and result in ambiguous business rules which cannot be interpreted by an automated information system. So, a need for a precise language to capture business rules can be identified. A specific notation form that can comply with a high level of precision, is a controlled natural language (CNL). During this research, a CNL is created which comprises: 15 fundamental constructs and an underlying formal grammar including 40 grammar rules. The created artifacts have been validated in three different rounds using sequentially 37 patterns, 252 business rules, and six business rules management systems by applying Mill's Method which indicated usefulness and completeness.},

Design/methodology/approach The study first reviews the literature of various contemporary risk management frameworks in order to identify gaps in project risk management knowledge. Then it develops a conceptual risk management framework using combined analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and risk map for managing project risks. The proposed framework has then been applied to a 1500\&\#xa0;km oil pipeline construction project in India in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. The concerned project stakeholders were involved through focus group discussions for applying the proposed risk management framework in the project under study. Findings The combined AHP and risk map approach is very effective to manage project risks across project, work package and activity levels. The risk factors in project level are caused because of external forces such as business environment (e.g. customers, competitors, technological development, politics, socio-economic environment). The risk factors in work package and activity levels are operational in nature and created due to internal causes such as lack of material and labor productivity, implementation issues, team ineffectiveness, etc. Practical implications The suggested model can be applied to any complex project and helps manage risk throughout the project life cycle. Originality/value Both business and operational risks constitute project risks. In one hand, the conventional project risk management frameworks emphasize on managing business risks and often ignore operational risks. On the other hand, the studies that deal with operational risk often do not link them with business risks. However, they need to be addressed in an integrated way as there are a few risks that affect only the specific level. Hence, this study bridges the gaps.},

  abstract = {The growing interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues is the result of a cultural path that sees banks react to market changes and become protagonists of an increasingly sustainable future. Based on these considerations, this paper intends to investigate the level of integration of sustainability issues in banks' corporate governance systems. We carry out an exploratory analysis on all European systematically important banks during the period 2015{\textendash}2019. By adopting the content analysis approach, we develop a novel governance score based on a research model made up of 40 items. We name the score: ``Bank's governance ESG (Environmental Social Governance) integrated index''. The main results of our study reveal not only growing awareness of banks to integrate sustainability in their corporate governance, but also a strong heterogeneity in their corporate behaviours and large rooms for improvement. Indeed, we find that just over half of the surveyed banks pay really attention to the integration of sustainability issues in their business and governance processes. This contribution is especially driven by the banks' boards of directors, whose size and composition contribute positively to overall sustainable performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study that investigates the level of integration of ESG factors in the banking sector, developing a quantitative score ranging from 0 to 100\%. This study differs from previous studies in that it develops an ``Bank's governance ESG integrated index'', which considers the areas of corporate governance that have the greatest impact on the implementation of sustainable practices in banks. Our research is limited to investigating the level of integration of ESG factors for listed banks over a 5-year period. In fact, our time horizon is represented by the four-year period 2015{\textendash}2019. This research has practical implications. First, investors more attentive on sustainability issues could identify and select the banks that best implement ESG criteria in their corporate governance systems. Second, our research model could be adopted by banks as a ``diagnostic tool'' to carry out a self-assessment process and identify possible room for improvement.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) is the art and science of how work should be performed in an organization in order to ensure consistent outputs and to take advantage of improvement opportunities, e.g. reducing costs, execution times or error rates. Importantly, BPM is not about improving the way individual activities are performed, but rather about managing entire chains of events, activities and decisions that ultimately produce added value for an organization and its customers. This textbook encompasses the entire BPM lifecycle, from process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling, analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management, computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners and vendors worldwide.    In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 100 hands-on exercises {\textendash} many with solutions {\textendash} as well as numerous suggestions for further reading. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website fundamentals-of-bpm.org.},

Thus, a comprehensive compliance management framework is required such that compliance management must crosscut all the stages of the complete business process lifecycle, starting from the very early stages of business process design. Formalizing compliance requirements based on a formal foundation of an expressive logical language enables the application of associated verification and analysis tools to ensure the compliance. In this paper, we have conducted a comparative analysis between three languages that can be used as the formal foundation of business process compliance requirements, focusing on design-time phase. Two main families of languages have been identified, which are: the temporal and deontic families of logic. In particular, we have considered LTL, CTL and FCL. The comparative analysis is based on the capabilities and limitations of each language and a set of required identified features.},

This paper proposes a semanticallyenabled compliance management framework that backs up the entire business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design-time verification, runtime and offline monitoring and analysis. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating domain, business and regulatory knowledge, at different levels of abstraction, which provides a shared conceptualization of the interrelated compliance and business specifics. Furthermore, given the technological revolution caused by cloud computing, we draw our vision on providing compliance-related ontologies as a service (COaaS) on the cloud. As an initial validation step, we have considered the financial sector with an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) case study and applied our semantic-based approach on.},

Such collaborations lead to inter-organizational business processes that may be commonly supported through the exchange of electronic data interchange (EDI) messages (e.g., electronic purchase orders, invoices etc.). Despite the appearance of XML, traditional approaches to EDI, such as EDIFACT and ANSI X.12, still play an overwhelmingly dominant role. However, such traditional EDI standards lack a notion of process. In other words, the exchanged business documents are typically not embedded in the context of other exchanged business documents. This has two shortcomings: (1) the inability to apply proven business process management (BPM) methods, including process mining techniques, in such settings; and (2) the unavailability of systematic approaches to business intelligence (BI) using information from exchanged EDI messages. In this article, we present the EDImine Framework for enabling (1) the application of process mining techniques in the field of EDI-supported inter-organizational business processes, and (2) for supporting inter-organizational performance evaluation using business information from EDI messages, event logs and process models. As an enabling technology, we present a method for the semantic preprocessing of EDIFACT messages to exploit this potentially rich source of information by applying state of the art BPM and BI techniques. We show the applicability of our approach by means of a case study based on real-world EDI data of a German consumer goods manufacturing company.},

First, a non-customized process view is constructed from an internal structured process model by aggregating internal activities the provider wishes to hide. Second, a customized process view is constructed by hiding and omitting activities from the non-customized view that are not requested by the process consumer. The feasibility of the approach is shown by means of a case study.},

Declarative process models support flexible process executions. Therefore, declarative business artifacts are a promising ingredient to support decision-intensive processes. However, there are several challenges that need to be overcome in order to support real-world decision-intensive processes with declarative business artifacts. This position paper discusses key challenges and discusses preliminary solutions to overcome them and turn declarative business artifacts into a mature modeling language for decision-intensive processes.},

Particular emphasis is placed on the need to verbalize new concepts, and sociocultural change. The latter is illustrated with examples from the development of accounting as an occupational interest group, and the adoption of Anglo-American accounting terminology and culture. The article concludes that language change in accounting, including transmission between languages and cultures, can inform accounting historians about the transfer of technical developments, as well as about socio-economic, political or ideological processes, power relationships, and the importance of terminology in jurisdictional disputes.},

We provide details of some of our initial findings of the REA/TOA analysis which we carried out on the SAP Human Capital Management (HCM) module. Given that SAP is recognized as the dominant ERP system with over 50\% of the market share, this technology is viewed as the representative case study technology for exploring the theory of REA in actual ERP systems. In particular O'Leary's and Dunn et al.'s works are expanded upon, substantiating O'Leary's findings that SAP was found to be consistent with REA in its database, semantic and structure orientations. Using SAP's HCM module as the exemplar, two notable discoveries are made. These are namely (i) identifying that several anomalies exist in the underlying data model, and (ii) that there are many more REA entities than previously discovered by Dunn et al. Through the SAP HCM exemplar it is shown that REA adds value to modelling business processes in ERP systems.},

Design/methodology/approach {\textendash} Hundreds of journals were searched using key terms identified in a preliminary literature review. Successive rounds of article abstract reviews resulted in 45 articles being selected for the compilation. CSF constructs were then identified using content analysis methodology and an inductive coding technique. A subsequent critical analysis identified gaps in the literature base. Findings {\textendash} The most significant finding is the lack of research that has focused on the identification of CSFs from the perspectives of key stakeholders. Additionally, there appears to be much variance with respect to what exactly is encompassed by change management, one of the most widely cited CSFs, and little detail of specific implementation tactics. Research limitations/implications {\textendash} There is a need to focus future research efforts on the study of CSFs as they apply to the perspectives of key stakeholders and to ensure that this stakeholder approach is also comprehensive in its coverage of CSFs. As well, there is need to conduct more in-depth research into the concept of change management. One key limitation of this research is the occurrence of duplication in the frequency analysis of the success factors. This is attributed to secondary research being the main methodology for a large number of the articles cited. Originality/value {\textendash} This research provides a comprehensive compilation of all previously identified ERP implementation success factors, through a clearly structured methodological approach.},

While many contributions in the literature focus on the determinants of ERM adoption and use one-dimensional feature to proxy for ERM implementation, we detect the consequences of ERM implementation and capture a variety of features to measure the sophistication of the ERM system. The results show that firms with advanced levels of ERM implementation present higher performance, both as financial performance and market evaluation. Additional tests also corroborate the expectation that effective ERM systems lead to higher performance by reducing risk exposure and that reverse causality between ERM and performance is not present in the short term. The study provides a twofold contribution to the ERM literature. First, it introduces new and more complete measures for ERM implementation, concerning not only corporate governance bodies dedicated to risk management, but also the characteristics of the risk assessment process. Moreover, it provides evidence of a positive relationship between ERM implementation and firm performance in an underinvestigated context such as Italy.},

The specifics of which work to outsource and when matter less than the quality of the three people new projects need which includes a strong, involved sponsor from the business side, an efficient project manager and a skilled technical specialist, says David Hutchison, president of Excipio Consulting, which specializes in cost-justification of technology projects. The first task is to get a technology project approved by business executives by demonstrating its potential payoff and keeping discussion focused on its business goals.  The second, most important, element to a project's success is the project manager, who should have more than just a couple of courses of project management and a reputation for being organized, according to Bob Wourms, director of outsourcing and professional staffing at the consultancy Project Management Solutions.  The third critical element is a skilled lead technologist, who can keep the programming on track and also oversee training for technical staffers who have moved on to the project in search of new challenges and skills.},

The SEC believes that ``ethics codes do, and should, vary from company to company.'' Using textual analysis techniques, we measure the extent of commonality across the documents. We find substantial levels of common sentences used by the firms, including a few cases where the codes of ethics are essentially identical. We consider these results in the context of legal statements versus value statements. While legal writing often mandates duplication, we argue that value-based statements should be held to a higher standard of originality. Our evidence is consistent with isomorphic pressures on smaller firms to conform.},

Considering their complexity, the development of these ``rich workflow-based Web applications'' requires a systematic approach taking key factors like strong user involvement and clear business objectives into account. To this end, we present an approach for the model-driven construction and evolution of such Web applications on the basis of workflow models which is founded on Domain-specific Languages (DSLs) and a supporting technical framework. We describe our approach's core DSL for workflow modeling which supports various modeling notations like BPMN or Petri nets and outline a set of DSLs used for designing workflow activities like dialog construction, data presentation and Web service communication. In conclusion, rich workflow-based Web applications can be built by modeling workflows and activities and passing them to the associated technical framework. The resulting running prototype can then be configured in detail using the presented DSLs.},

This profile provides a conceptual meta-model for the anatomy of regulations and maps its elements to standard GRL with specialized annotations and links, with analysis techniques that exploit this additional information.

Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy-to-use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams.                                         Methods and Findings                                We developed a free-to-use, Open Source R package and web-based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web-based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here;                 https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/                 .                                                        Conclusions                                We have developed a user-friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020-compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (                 https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma\_flowdiagram/                 ). This free-to-use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.},

The sentiment (tone, opinion) is assessed using several categorization schemes in order to explore various aspects of language used in the annual reports of U.S. companies.

Eleven categories of sentiment (ranging from negative and positive to active and common) are used as the inputs of the prediction models. Support vector machines provide the highest forecasting accuracy. This evidence suggests that there exist non-linear relationships between the sentiment and financial performance. The results indicate that the sentiment information is an important forecasting determinant of financial performance and, thus, can be used to support decision-making process of corporate stakeholders.

Thus, the EA approach would be significantly more promising if the data used when creating the models could be collected automatically{\textemdash}a topic not yet properly addressed by either academia or industry. This paper proposes network scanning for automatic data collection and uses an existing software tool for generating EA models (ArchiMate is employed as an example) based on the IT infrastructure of enterprises. While some manual effort is required to make the models fully useful to many practical scenarios (e.g., to detail the actual services provided by IT components), empirical results show that the methodology is accurate and (in its default state) require little effort to carry out.},

Previously surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches, and categories them based on different compliance management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000{\textendash}2015. The survey results reveal that mostly compliance management approaches center around three distinct categories namely: design-time (28\%), run-time (32\%) and auditing (10\%).

  abstract = {Code compliance checking has been the subject of scientific research for more than four decades and has been put into practice in numerous projects. To date, however, no universally valid, sustainable approach to the rule-based compliance checking of models has been established. Visual programming languages are easier to understand and thus more transparent than textual formats. The study presented here analyzes the requirements specified in the guidelines of the Deutsche Bahn AG regarding the technical design of structures in railway construction and examines the feasibility of implementing these rules using BPMN and DMN. The rules analyzed are categorized into 12 different classes. Depending on the guideline subset, the BPMN/DMN approach was found to be useable in 37\%-75\% of the 943 rules examined. Considering only those rules that are relevant for the digital railway model, 68\% of the rules can be represented and automated using BPMN and DMN.},

The Compliance management maturity model (CMMM) is one measurement method that can help the organization assess the degree of Compliance Management implementation and the effectiveness of compliance management practices to help the organization achieve its objectives. To determine and identify the state-of-the-art CMMM, this study will enumerate and synthesize current CMMM and map their similarities and differences. Furthermore, to determine if the existing enterprise CMMM can measure the current Compliance Management practices by using the ISO 37301 international Standard as a proxy for a state-of-theart Compliance Management system. The synthesizing process of the enterprise CMMM uses the literature review approach on the existing CMMM and ISO 37301 as the primary benchmark reference. The findings show that despite organizations facing increasing complexity and organizational characteristics of internal and external regulations, the CMMM as Compliance Management measurement tools are very few. The result also shows that the existing CMMM cannot cover all the current CMMM requirements needed from the International Standard.},

While some authors have attributed large productivity improvements and substantial consumer benefits to IT, others report that IT has not had any bottom line impact on business profitability. This paper focuses on the fact that while productivity, consumer value, and business profitability are related, they are ultimately separate questions. Accordingly, the empirical results on IT value depend heavily on which question is being addressed and what data are being used. Applying methods based on economic theory, we are able to define and examine the relevant hypotheses for each of these three questions, using recent firm-level data on IT spending by 370 large firms. Our findings indicate that IT has increased productivity and created substantial value for consumers. However, we do not find evidence that these benefits have resulted in supranormal business profitability. We conclude that while modeling techniques need to be improved, these results are collectively consistent with economic theory. Thus, there is no inherent contradiction between increased productivity, increased consumer value, and unchanged business profitability.]}

We follow with a review of the literature, beginning with research examining the adoption and use of XBRL by capital market participants. Next, we discuss data quality concerns that may impact the use of XBRL data, followed by a discussion of how auditors use XBRL data and their potential role in the assurance of the data. We then present literature that uses meta and underlying XBRL data to examine financial statement characteristics and disclosure properties. Based on the review of the literature, we identify topics with the greatest potential for future research.}

A number of research surveys have however shown that such programs are particularly prone to errors. Some reasons for the error-proneness of spreadsheets are that spreadsheets are developed by end users and that standard software quality assurance processes are mostly not applied. Correspondingly, during the last two decades, researchers have proposed a number of techniques and automated tools aimed at supporting the end user in the development of error-free spreadsheets. In this paper, we provide a review of the research literature and develop a classification of automated spreadsheet quality assurance (QA) approaches, which range from spreadsheet visualization, static analysis and quality reports, over testing and support to model-based spreadsheet development. Based on this review, we outline possible opportunities for future work in the area of automated spreadsheet QA.},

In this paper, we demonstrate{\textemdash}using procurement data from a leading global bank{\textemdash}the value added in an audit setting of a new type of analytical procedure: process mining of event logs. In particular, using process mining, we are able to identify numerous transactions that we consider to be audit-relevant information, including payments made without approval, violations of segregation of duty controls, and violations of company-specific internal procedures. Furthermore, these identified anomalies were not detected by the bank's internal auditors when they conducted their examination of that same data using conventional audit procedures, thus establishing the benefits of using process mining to complement existing audit methods. Process mining is a very different approach to evidence collection and analysis as it does not focus on the value of transactions and its aggregations, but on the transactional processes themselves. In addition to demonstrating the benefits of process mining in an audit context, this paper also discusses the contributions that process mining can make both to accounting research and auditing practice.},

The quality of the service that the client receives depends partly on the client's own involvement in the project. This will require the client to take a positive approach to promoting continuous improvement to all work situations. The traditional role of the client's representative varies from one of simply designing to the full monitoring of the project. It may also include project management activities such as planning, scheduling, coordinating and motivating. In total quality management (TQM) the administrative tasks of the client's representative include many aspects already addressed under traditional arrangements. However, current literature suggests that confusion exists over the involvement and participation of the client's representative when TQM is adopted in construction projects. To address this problem, research was conducted to identify the critical tasks for the client's representative to achieve total quality in construction. The findings also developed relevant best practices to be performed by the client's representative. This paper concentrates on the tasks of the client's representative, and assesses their importance in terms of improving quality in construction.

This figure for cost overrun is referred to frequently by scientific researchers, software process improvement consultants, and government advisors. In this paper, we review the validity of the Standish Group's 1994 cost overrun results. Our review is based on a comparison of the 189\% cost overrun figure with the cost overrun figures reported in other cost estimation surveys, and an examination of the Standish Group's survey design and analysis methods. We find that the figure reported by the Standish Group is much higher than those reported in similar estimation surveys and that there may be severe problems with the survey design and methods of analysis, e.g. the population sampling method may be strongly biased towards `failure projects'. We conclude that the figure of 189\% for cost overruns is probably much too high to represent typical software projects in the 1990s and that a continued use of that figure as a reference point for estimation accuracy may lead to poor decision making and hinder progress in estimation practices.},

Intelligent autonomous robots, independent if they are humanoid/anthropomorphic or not, will have a physical presence, make autonomous decisions, and interact with all stakeholders in the society, in yet unforeseen manners. The symbiosis with such sophisticated robots may lead to a fundamental civilizational shift, with far-reaching effects as philosophical, legal, and societal questions on consciousness, citizenship, rights, and legal entity of robots are raised. The aim of this work is to understand the broad scope of potential issues pertaining to law and society through the investigation of the interplay of law, robots, and society via different angles such as law, social, economic, gender, and ethical perspectives. The results make it evident that in an era of symbiosis with intelligent autonomous robots, the law systems, as well as society, are not prepared for their prevalence. Therefore, it is now the time to start a multi-disciplinary stakeholder discussion and derive the necessary policies, frameworks, and roadmaps for the most eminent issues.},

However, it can be quite difficult for grassroots organizations to access suitable settings, times, and collocated audiences. One context that can yield this type of access is an event, as it constitutes a rare opportunity for organizations to engage in practices that impact credibility advancement. We investigate how a volunteer-based grassroots organization orchestrates a high-profile event at the United Nations to promote African diaspora entrepreneurs as a valuable force in the mitigation of development challenges in their home countries. We employ qualitative data collected from ethnographic observations, interviews, and secondary sources and apply grounded theory approaches to demonstrate how organizational credibility can be advanced through performative strategizing within event settings. Drawing from heuristics used in theatrical performances, we found that the grassroots organization mobilized specific audience groups in participative role-playing across two acts, thereby producing and consecrating a temporary simulacrum of a cause-related community it claimed to represent. Our findings demonstrate how an unproven organization can strategically use audience mobilization to convert event settings into performative spaces for simulacrum creation and credibility advancement.},

However, when AIS are large, complex, and distributed, their system flowcharts are difficult to comprehend, challenging to use, and insufficient to support decision making in system design and implementation. In this primer we propose a set of requirements for modeling and documenting complex AIS that address those concerns. Since most other models such as SSAD, UML, and BPMN used to represent AIS are influenced by or can be reduced to Petri net models, we compare system flowcharts with Petri net representation of AIS. We evaluate systems flowcharts and Petri nets for their suitability in modeling AIS. We find that Petri nets are an attractive alternative due to their extensive capability to perform analytics and simulation. Analytics can be used to study structural and behavioral properties while simulations can help study run-time behavior of systems to evaluate computing capacity and system performance. We provide a detailed description and guidelines of how design analytics and implementation analytics can be achieved based on the Petri net framework. With this unified modeling strategy, we also describe how it can support the process of audit analytics. Petri nets are popular in computer science, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain management, and business process reengineering. We explore this viable method for rigorous study of AIS modeling and documentation.},

Manual procedures for text classification work well for up to a few hundred documents. However, when the number of documents is larger, manual procedures become laborious, time-consuming, and potentially unreliable. Techniques from text mining facilitate the automatic assignment of text strings to categories, making classification expedient, fast, and reliable, which creates potential for its application in organizational research. The purpose of this article is to familiarize organizational researchers with text mining techniques from machine learning and statistics. We describe the text classification process in several roughly sequential steps, namely training data preparation, preprocessing, transformation, application of classification techniques, and validation, and provide concrete recommendations at each step. To help researchers develop their own text classifiers, the R code associated with each step is presented in a tutorial. The tutorial draws from our own work on job vacancy mining. We end the article by discussing how researchers can validate a text classification model and the associated output.},

  abstract = {A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were{\textemdash}and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of ``normal science,'' as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking's introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. ~Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.},

Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

As a motivation, the effectiveness of the SWRL/OWL combination in modeling domain facts is discussed while some of the common expressive limitations of the combination are also highlighted. The paper then classifies and presents the relevant language extensions of the SWRL and their added expressive powers to the original SWRL definition. Furthermore, it provides a comparative analysis of the syntax and semantics of the proposed extensions. In conclusion, the decidability requirement and usability of each expressiveness extension are evaluated towards an efficient inclusion into the OWL ontologies.},

This paper investigates the use of DSR methodology by examining articles published in the BISE community's primary outlets. We focus on understanding the artifacts created, the foundations for building these artifacts, and the evaluation methods used. The results reveal a) a broad view of foundations for DSR by incorporating artifacts that are used in practice, b) the focus on the organization as the unit of analysis, c) a pluralism of research methods that cater to the timeliness of problems addressed, and d) low level of theoretical underpinnings, thus lacking in DSR rigor aspects.},

Written by a best selling author with over 40 years of experiences in the construction and general contracting business, Construction Process Planning and Management provides you with the necessary tools to save time and money on your construction project. In this book, Sid Levy provides valuable advice for avoiding or working through the common problems that are a result of the long-term nature of construction projects, failure to select a?project delivery system? appropriate to the project, incomplete drawing and specifications, unrealistic scheduling, poor communication and coordination among participants, and inadequate contract administration. From project genesis, through design development to contractor and contract selection, on to construction oversight, punch list and successful project close-out, this book will point out those pitfalls to avoid and offer practical advice at every step along the way. Administer the general construction process including solicitation of contractor's qualifications (pre-qualify bidders), comparative analysis of bid packages, recommendation for contract award, contract document negotiation and documentation of job change orders. Provide Project Planning and on-site management and coordination of all construction projects. Ensure compliance of building construction rules and regulations and collaborate with chief engineers to monitor quality of construction. Conduct technical/plan review of construction documents and submit written responses identifying required corrections or changes.

  abstract = {Summary: The rate of failure of IT projects has remained little changed in survey after survey over the past 15-20 years-over 40-50\%. This has happened in spite of new technology, innovative methods and tools, and different management methods. Why does this happen? Why can't the situation be better? One reason is that many think of each IT effort as unique. In reality many IT projects are very similar at a high, strategic level. Where they differ is in the people and exact events-the detail. If you read the literature or have been in information systems or IT for some time, you have seen the same reasons for failure and the same problems and issues recur again and again. In this book IT Management experts Ben Lientz and Lee Larssen show you how to identify and track the recurring issues leading to failure in IT projects and provide a proven, modern method for addressing them. By following the recommendations in this books readers can significantly reduce the risk of IT failures and increase the rate of success. Benefits of using this approach: .Issues are identified earlier-giving more time for solution and action. .Issues are resolved more consistently since the approach tracks on their repetition. .You get an early warning of problems in IT work-before the budget or schedule fall apart. .Management tends to have more realistic expectations with an awareness of issues. .Users and managers have greater confidence in IT due to the improved handling of issues. .Since the number of issues tends to stabilize in an organization, the IT organization and management get better at detecting, preventing, and dealing with issues over time-cumulative improvement. .Giving attention to issues make users more realistic in their requests and acts to deter requirement changes and scope creep. * Full of checklists and methods that can be used in day to day Project Management work in real companies * Easy to read style and book organization allows the reader to jump into the book right at the point they need * Shows how to set up an issues database for better identification and tracking of issues, providing an Early Warning System to help move the project to success. Summary: The authors "show you how to identify and track the recurring issues leading to failure in IT projects, and [they] provide a proven, modern method for addressing them.

Specifically, the author focuses on research related to earnings quality, stock market efficiency, and corporate financial policies using the textual information in corporate disclosures. In this survey, he focuses on empirical large-sample textual analysis studies built upon the latest development in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and statistics. However, several challenges exist for researchers who want to advance this literature. First, much of the existing research has a strong methodology flavor. Second, like many other empirical studies in the accounting literature, the large-sample textual analysis literature also raises concerns about endogeneity. Third, for some studies especially for studies that attempt to measure managerial characteristics using the corporate filings, there could be some concerns about who actually writes the corporate disclosures.},

In dit boek wordt een aanpak beschreven om de vertaling van wetgeving naar ICT te ondersteunen. Het bestaat uit een taalmodel, een wetgevingsvocabulaire en toepassing van de techniek van linked data om de betekenis van wetgeving te duiden. Daarnaast worden op basis van analyse van agile werkwijzen die in systeem- en softwareontwikkeling worden ingezet, voorstellen gedaan om tot een multidisciplinaire en iteratieve werkwijze te komen in het ambtelijke en parlementaire wetgevingsproces.

  abstract = {Publicly traded companies are required to submit periodic reports with eXtensive Business Reporting Language (xbrl) word-level tags. Manually tagging the reports is tedious and costly. We, therefore, introduce xbrl tagging as a new entity extraction task for the financial domain and release finer-139, a dataset of 1.1M sentences with gold xbrl tags. Unlike typical entity extraction datasets, finer139 uses a much larger label set of 139 entity types. Most annotated tokens are numeric, with the correct tag per token depending mostly on context, rather than the token itself. We show that subword fragmentation of numeric expressions harms bert's performance, allowing word-level bilstms to perform better. To improve bert's performance, we propose two simple and effective solutions that replace numeric expressions with pseudotokens reflecting original token shapes and numeric magnitudes. We also experiment with fin-bert, an existing bert model for the financial domain, and release our own bert (sec-bert), pre-trained on financial filings, which performs best. Through data and error analysis, we finally identify possible limitations to inspire future work on xbrl tagging.},

  abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore a case study example of the decision-making process that occurs within complex organizations. It exposes a murky "zone" of decision making and action between the strategic vision set by senior management and the work of teams to realise projects. Design/methodology/approach - A case study from the experience of one of the authors is used to illustrate the activities in this "zone". The lessons from the case study are supported by emerging project management and general management literature. The paper is exploratory in nature and the case study used provides a useful vehicle for reflection and sensemaking. Findings - The "zone" is metaphorically described as a highly complex and dynamic organism. Operating in the "zone" requires agility and an understanding of both the project and the organizational environment to cope with the demands of its chaotic nature. The paper's conclusions indicate that the traditional command-and-control management style is counter-productive in today's organizations. Research limitations/implications - Key implications include the need for project managers and their teams to be politically astute and sensitive to the needs and pressures of a wide range of project stakeholders. A methodology and tool for visualising the influence of stakeholders can be of considerable use and a flexible style of decision making is necessary to manage within the inherent uncertainty, complexity and chaos found in projects and organizations like the one illustrated by the case study. Originality/value - Shows that a paradigm shift in management thinking is needed to succeed in managing projects and their teams within the turbulent environment of a modern matrix organization.

Process mining uses such data to gain insights about the real execution of processes. In this thesis, we address research challenges in which a multi-perspective view on processes is needed and that look beyond the control-flow perspective, which defines the sequence of activities of a process. We consider problems in which multiple interacting process perspectives {\textemdash} in particular control-flow, data, resources, time, and functions {\textemdash} are considered together. The contributed methods span several types of process mining: two are concerned with conformance checking, two are process discovery techniques, and one is a decision mining method. All methods have been implemented, evaluated, and applied in the context of four case studies.},

In previous work we defined the REA-DSL operational layer reflecting actual business events which ''have occurred'' or ''are occurring''. In this paper we extend the REA-DSL by the planning layer capturing what future events ''are scheduled'' or ''are planned'' by commitments. Now, our REA-DSL covers all basic concepts to describe a full accounting infrastructure. The REA-DSL may serve as a solid basis for generating a conceptual AIS data model - which is subject to future work.},

The notion of collective competence is increasingly being seen as a vital precondition for the success of project teams, particularly in extreme environments. However, we still know little about the ingredients of this collective competence. To partially fill this gap, we make use of the insights offered by the very particular world of the French Special Forces, which have been operating successfully for several decades in extreme environments. Based on an in-depth qualitative study of their project-based mode of operations, we detail the six main ingredients of the collective competence that underpins the activities of commando units in the field and insist upon the criticality of the pre- and postmission phases during which this collective competence is actively reinforced.

However, they better understand structured natural language, such as SBVR that defines the meaning of business concepts and make them unambiguously understandable by human experts and also by software systems. The solution presented in this paper allows transforming BPMN 2.0 business process models into SBVR business vocabularies and business rules. This solution is implemented as a plug-in and is available in the MagicDraw CASE tool. An experimental evaluation of the proposed solution with three domain areas proved that SBVR business vocabulary and business rules could be fully obtained from BPMN 2.0 business process model when certain requirements for BPMN 2.0 business process model are met. The advantages of the solution are an automatic transformation for various BPMN modelling situations, tracing links between two models in one modelling environment and avoidance of necessity to use linguistic techniques.},

Change in the construction industry is inevitable, and it occurs to some degree during almost every construction project. Changes may be minor, such as requesting additional money for the purchase of a valve. Or, changes may be complex, such as requesting millions of dollars for schedule delays and labor productivity losses. This article identifies six steps for the parties involved in a construction project to implement as part of change order management prior to the start of construction, during project execution, and if resolution regarding a change is not reached, through the negotiation process. Following these steps can help ensure that changes are managed efficiently and effectively, which, in turn, can lead to the overall success of a project.

  abstract = {The private equity asset class has grown rapidly since 2008, attracting institutional investors in need of higher returns than those expected from public markets. But while most investors would say they have been rewarded with good performance, this success is hard to objectively demonstrate due to intransitive metrics and unmeasured risks. It is our belief that there is a pressing need to substantiate the economic case for private equity. In this article, we describe a new transparency framework, which we situate in our research agenda on `organic finance'. The framework uses data science technology to operationalize private equity data and institute a scientific approach to performance measurement. We elucidate what scientific measurement should look like in private equity, incorporating examples of technologies in use today. We also reveal how bringing new levels of transparency into the asset class can, on its own, create significant value. Finally, we look at the effect of organic finance on the industry, connecting greater transparency to a structural shift that enables efficiencies, expansion, and innovation. The magnitude and sustainability of this shift reinforces the economic case for private equity, albeit with far more transparency than is practiced today.},

  abstract = {Context Business process modeling is an essential part of understanding and redesigning the activities that a typical enterprise uses to achieve its business goals. The quality of a business process model has a significant impact on the development of any enterprise and IT support for that process. Objective Since the insights on what constitutes modeling quality are constantly evolving, it is unclear whether research on business process modeling quality already covers all major aspects of modeling quality. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the state of the art on business process modeling quality: What aspects of process modeling quality have been addressed until now and which gaps remain to be covered? Method We performed a systematic literature review of peer reviewed articles as published between 2000 and August 2013 on business process modeling quality. To analyze the contributions of the papers we use the Formal Concept Analysis technique. Results We found 72 studies addressing quality aspects of business process models. These studies were classified into different dimensions: addressed model quality type, research goal, research method, and type of research result. Our findings suggest that there is no generally accepted framework of model quality types. Most research focuses on empirical and pragmatic quality aspects, specifically with respect to improving the understandability or readability of models. Among the various research methods, experimentation is the most popular one. The results from published research most often take the form of intangible knowledge. Conclusion We believe there is a lack of an encompassing and generally accepted definition of business process modeling quality. This evidences the need for the development of a broader quality framework capable of dealing with the different aspects of business process modeling quality. Different dimensions of business process quality and of the process of modeling still require further research.},

It discusses how, in the absence of a globally integrated financial framework, past and present regulations and interventions in reaction to national and global financial crises did not resolve the cross border regulatory arbitrage. The paper discusses how crises often lead to the emergence of new national and international institutions. It also analyses the proposed ``new global framework'' that needs to be in place if the policy recommendations contained in the G20 communiqu{\'e} are going to be effectively implemented. The paper argues that unless international agreements are ratified by all nations and become part of national rules and laws, the presence of regulatory arbitrage and the lack of adequate cross border information and data may prevent the global economy from addressing the underlying causes of the recent global financial crisis. The paper also discusses the evolution of central banks and their new role in contributing to global financial stability. The paper argues that the recent global financial crisis has provided a unique opportunity to go beyond economic data and attempt to capture cross border financial data and other information that could assist international and national institutions to measure and manage financial risk more effectively. Finally, the paper discusses ``too big to fail'' and argues that only an internationally integrated financial system will make large banks global, both when operational and in the event of insolvency.},

BPMN offers a wide range of modeling constructs, significantly more than other popular languages. However, not all of these constructs are equally important in practice as business analysts frequently use arbitrary subsets of BPMN. In this paper we investigate what these subsets are, and how they differ between academic, consulting, and general use of the language. We analyzed 120 BPMN diagrams using mathematical and statistical techniques. Our findings indicate that BPMN is used in groups of several, well-defined construct clusters, but less than 20\% of its vocabulary is regularly used and some constructs did not occur in any of the models we analyzed. While the average model contains just 9 different BPMN constructs, models of this complexity have typically just 4-5 constructs in common, which means that only a small agreed subset of BPMN has emerged. Our findings have implications for the entire ecosystems of analysts and modelers in that they provide guidance on how to reduce language complexity, which should increase the ease and speed of process modeling.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management is considered an essential strategy to create and maintain competitive advantage by streamlining and monitoring corporate processes. While the identification of critical success factors for the management of business process related projects has been addressed by some research projects, the risks associated with these projects have received considerably less attention. This is a concern: Although BPM projects contain phases that relate to traditional software development and deployment projects, the application of risk mitigation strategies found in software engineering ignores the subsequent process management phases that follow upon the implementation and automation of processes. This paper provides an overview of risks associated with BPM projects along the phases of the BPM lifecycle. After a classification of the risks identified with individual lifecycle phases and transitions we discuss four strategies to deal with these risks: avoidance, mitigation, transfer, and acceptance. The outlook of this paper discusses how assessment frameworks such as CobIT and COSO can be applied to risk management in the context of BPM.},

  abstract = {The Design and Engineering Methodology for Organisations (DEMO) is a core method within the discipline of Enterprise Engineering (EE). It enables the creation of so-called essential models of enterprises. Such models are enterprise models that aim to focus on the organisational essence of an enterprise by leaving out (as much as possible) details of the socio-technical implementation. The organisational essence is then expressed primarily in terms of the actor roles involved, and the business transactions between these roles. The DEMO method has a firm theoretical foundation. At the same time, there is an increasing uptake of DEMO in practice. This also results in a need for enterprise-grade tool support for the use of the method. In this thesis, we report on a study concerning the selection, configuration, and extension, of an enterprise-grade tool to support the use of DEMO in practice with the need of the automatic verification and exchange of DEMO models. The configuration of the selected tool framework to support DEMO modelling, provided general insights regarding the development of enterprise-grade tool support for (model-driven) methods such as DEMO, while also providing feedback on the consistency and completeness of the DEMO Specification Language (DEMOSL); the specification language that accompanies the DEMO method.},

To better understand the effect of data source choice on IRC measurement, we design and implement a data quality assessment framework specifically for bibliographic data by reviewing and selecting available dimensions and designing appropriate computable metrics, and then validate the framework by applying it to four popular sources of bibliographic data: Microsoft Academic Graph, Web of Science (WoS), Dimensions, and the ACM Digital Library. Successful validation of the framework suggests it is consistent with the popular conceptual framework of information quality proposed by Wang and Strong (1996) and adequately identifies the differences in quality in the sources examined. Application of the framework reveals that WoS has the highest overall quality among the sets considered; and that the differences in quality can be explained primarily by how the data sources are organized. Our study comprises a methodological contribution that enables researchers to apply this IRC measurement tool in their studies and makes an empirical contribution by further characterizing four popular sources of bibliographic data and their impact on IRC measurement.},

Case study reports on the successful use of agile practices in small distributed projects already exist. How these practices can be applied to larger projects, however, remains unstudied. This paper reports a case study on agile practices in a 40-person development organization distributed between Norway and Malaysia. Based on seven interviews in the development organization, we describe how scrum practices were successfully applied, e.g. using teleconferencing and web cameras for daily scrum meetings, synchronized 4-week sprints, weekly scrum-of-scrums, and Jira for backlog management. Non-scrum agile practices included nightly builds, automated testing, and team rooms. Supportig global software development practices, e.g. frequent visits, unofficial distributed meetings, domain expert networks, and annual gatherings are described. Positive experiences of using scrum included improved communication, trust and motivation, as well as better perceived quality. Challenges included misunderstood requirements, lack of videoconferencing possibilities, and awkward communication in distributed meetings due to cultural and geographical distance.

  abstract = {Background: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did and what they found. Over the last decade, there have been many advances in systematic review methodology and terminology, which have necessitated an update to the guideline.Objectives: To develop the PRISMA 2020 statement for reporting systematic reviews.Methods: We reviewed 60 documents with reporting guidance for systematic reviews to generate suggested modifications to the PRISMA 2009 statement. We sought feedback on the suggested modifications through an online survey of 110 systematic review methodologists and journal editors. The results of the review and survey were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, drafts of the PRISMA 2020 checklist, abstract checklist, explanation and elaboration and flow diagram were generated and refined iteratively based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers.Results: In this statement paper, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews. The checklist includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement.Conclusions: The PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to facilitate transparent, complete and accurate reporting of systematic reviews. Improved reporting should benefit users of reviews, including guideline developers, policy makers, health care providers, patients and other stakeholders. In order to achieve this, we encourage authors, editors and peer-reviewers to adopt the guideline.},

This issue is becoming more and more crucial for multinationals, therefore more research on this subject is required. Business entities that have introduced computerized tax compliance systems achieve a substantial competitive advantage over other market players. Thus, the aim of this paper is to analyse barriers to the implementation of SAP (the most common ERP) tax compliance modules and to present the results of in-depth surveys with professionals using this system. This article also discusses the role of SAP as a tool for tax compliance and the most important challenges of its implementation process.},

Therefore EA models and business process models must be linked to address in detail both structural and behavioural aspects of the information system. However linked EA and business process models do not imply that the models provide complete and lawful descriptions of the information system.

  abstract = {Why do some teams consistently deliver high performance while other, seemingly identical teams struggle? Led by Sandy Pentland, researchers at MIT's Human Dynamics Laboratory set out to solve that puzzle. Hoping to decode the "It factor" that made groups click, they equipped teams from a broad variety of projects and industries (comprising 2,500 individuals in total) with wearable electronic sensors that collected data on their social behavior for weeks at a time. With remarkable consistency, the data showed that the most important predictor of a team's success was its communication patterns. Those patterns were as significant as all other factors-intelligence, personality, talent-combined. In fact, the researchers could foretell which teams would outperform simply by looking at the data on their communication, without even meeting their members. In this article Pentland shares the secrets of his findings and shows how anyone can engineer a great team. He has identified three key communication dynamics that affect performance: energy,engagement, and exploration. Drawing from the data, he has precisely quantified the ideal team patterns for each. Even more significant, he has seen that when teams map their own communication behavior over time and then make adjustments that move it closer to the ideal, they can dramatically improve their performance.

This paper proposes a software framework based on a semantic data model that helps in deriving and analysing regulatory reporting processes from event repositories. The key idea is in using business-like templates for expressing commonly used constraints associated with the definition of regulatory reporting processes and mapping these templates with those provided by an existing process definition language. A case study investigates the efficacy of the proposed solution in the case of an ``Off-market bid'' regulatory process. The results demonstrate the capability of the architecture in deriving process instances from a repository of Australian Company Announcements provided by the Australian Securities Exchange.},

In this paper we argue that MDE offers "low hanging fruit" if creating executable UML models is targeted rather than developing full-fledged information systems. This paper describes an environment for designing and validating conceptual business models using the model-driven architecture (MDA). The deliverable of the proposed modelling environment is an executable platform independent model (EPIM) that is further tested and validated through an MDA-based simulation feature. The proposed environment addresses a set of challenges associated with 1. shortcomings of the UML for being technically too complex for conceptual modelling goals as well as for being not precise enough  for rapid prototyping; 2. difficulties of MDE adoption due to the large set of required skills to adopt the key MDA standards such as the UML and XMI for developing and maintaining a requirements prototyping tools.

As with every type of conceptual model, a business process model has to meet certain syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic quality requirements to be of value. For many years, such quality aspects were investigated by centering on the properties of the model artifact itself. Only recently, the process of model creation is considered as a factor that influences the resulting model's quality. Our work contributes to this stream of research and presents an explorative analysis of the process of process modeling (PPM). We report on two large-scale modeling sessions involving 115 students. In these sessions, the act of model creation, i.e., the PPM, was automatically recorded. We conducted a cluster analysis on this data and identified three distinct styles of modeling. Further, we investigated how both task- and modeler-specific factors influence particular aspects of those modeling styles. Based thereupon, we propose a model that captures our insights. It lays the foundations for future research that may unveil how high-quality process models can be established through better modeling support and modeling instruction.},

They are fostering awareness and process-related communication by leveraging the benefits of visual notations. However, in contrast to business process diagrams, where nowadays BPMN prevails, process landscape diagrams lack standardization. Accordingly, the main objective of our efforts is to define an effective language for modeling of process landscapes, which is visually compliant with current landscape modeling approaches and structurally related to the BPMN standard. This was achieved by following the design science research methodology in which the proposed solution (named BPMN-L) was characterized, designed, and implemented by analyzing existing process landscape languages and approaches. Afterward, BPMN-L based diagrams were demonstrated and validated quantitatively and with a `proof-of-concept' approach. The results show that BPMN-L is visually compatible with current landscape modeling approaches, especially value chains as well it suits well with multi-abstraction layered modeling based on BPMN. The investigated sample landscape diagrams demonstrate that all concepts, which are specified in BPMN-L, are applicable also in practice. Overall, the proposed solution has the potential to standardize and simplify process landscape discovery and modeling, semi-automate triggering of processes in a value chain and improve the consistency as well as the compatibility of processes architectures.},

This is where social media comes to the foreground. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to study the evolution of research on social media implementation in the field of business process management. A systematic literature review was carried out following a search for and selection of articles that met our objective. To classify the sampled papers, we followed validated frameworks regarding social media management and business process management. Additionally, a detailed look at the sampled case studies was done to highlight companies' experiences in the field. Our final sample comprised 47 papers that simultaneously encompassed social media and business process management. The papers were classified according to their publishing frequency, the article type, both the topics and sectors to which they belonged, their methodological approaches, and the importance for business process management capability areas as well as capability subareas. Finally, word frequency queries were used to better understand diverse social media applications in business processes and to derive practical recommendations. The necessity for a multidisciplinary approach toward business processes was detected; therefore, topics, such as psychology, business economics, or information systems, were included, emphasizing innovation strategies, including gamification, big data, or crowdsourcing. Our most important recommendation concerns the evolution of business process management through different social media tools as a means to achieve a transition toward the recommended omnichannel management approach.},

  abstract = {Conceptual models of business processes and related business process modeling languages play a crucial role in today's information systems research and practice. Common BPMLs such as BPMN 2.0 or EPC are widely accepted and applied in various domains. However, such BPMLs provide a set of generic process modeling elements but do not allow for modeling domain specific concepts. This also holds true for control means as one of the key concepts for process audits. To address this gap, this paper presents an empirically grounded extension of the EPC with modeling concepts for process-integrated control means. The results of a laboratory experiment with 58 participants demonstrate that the extension facilitates a comprehensive enactment of process audits. In conclusion, the results of this research project are contrasted with a previously designed BPMN 2.0 extension in order to present insights we gain from extending two different BPMLs with the same domain concept.},

  abstract = {Domain specific languages (DSLs) bring substantial increase in productivity and quality and thus look very appealing to software engineering practitioners. Because language workbenches can drastically reduce the cost of building and maintaining DSLs and associated tooling, they catch the attention of technical leads and project managers in the industry. Effective use of language engineering technologies for software development requires specific knowledge about building DSLs in general and about language workbenches in particular. Practicing software engineers need to enrich their skills with a new software development approach and the supporting tools. In this paper we present our experiences with training and coaching software practitioners in developing domain specific languages and the associated tooling with Jetbrains' Meta-Programming System. We distill the experience that we have gained over the last three years while running 16 trainings organized by three different organizations. The trainings were attended by over 50 developers, who work in different business domains and posses a wide variety of technical backgrounds, previous experiences and concrete needs. We present a set of challenges faced while teaching language engineering technologies in the industry. To address these challenges we developed a curriculum containing increasingly complex topics and an approach, which combines classical trainings with continuous coaching either remotely or on site. Based on our experience we distill a set of lessons learnt about the dissemination of language engineering technologies to practitioners. We identify several concrete needs which are key to broader adoption of language engineering in practice.},

The absence of empirical evaluations on their use and usefulness, however, raises the question whether practitioners are attracted to using those techniques. In this paper, we present a study on what practitioners think of declarative modeling. We show that the practitioners we involved in this study are receptive to the idea of a hybrid approach combining imperative and declarative techniques, rather than making a full shift from the imperative to the declarative paradigm. Moreover, we report on requirements, use cases, limitations, and tool support of such a hybrid approach. Based on the gained insight, we propose a research agenda for the development of this novel modeling approach.},

These datasets vary in their spatial and temporal (and other) representations that the DL allows however to consistently represent in a multi-dimensional data framework. Proper curation facilitates interoperability and dissemination via other tools. We thus use popular python libraries (e.g. xarray, numpy, pandas) to query, manipulate and visualize the data and then build web applications to facilitate their exploration. The content and the interface of those applications, which we call Maprooms, are co-developed with the PRISM scientists in order to design the most relevant way to communicate their results.},

The objective of this paper is to examine a decade (1998-2008) of XBRL articles published in various publications including trade, practitioner and academic journals to identify trends and patterns, milestones, and organizations actively contributed to this development. Another goal is to assess public perceptions of XBRL, its capabilities and its future. We examined published articles where XBRL appeared either in the title or abstract of the article during 1998-2008. Considering that XBRL reporting is being required only in recent years, the research shows various interest groups worked together for a long time to achieve a common goal. The academic community has also been proactive in contributing to and assessing this new reporting standard. There is a trail of research articles to document this contribution. This paper provides various charts and interesting statistics.},

  abstract = {The real estate sector is often presented as an exemplary field that benefits from practical blockchain applications. The general hypothesis is that, in theory, blockchain could solve some significant challenges the real estate sector is facing, such as nontransparency, inefficiencies, fraud and corruption, high costs, and trust issues. However, the literature focuses on blockchain's theoretical benefits, challenges, or concepts. This research aims to understand the recent developments in the blockchain literature, specifically in the real estate sector, and to understand the current real-world applications by collecting empirical evidence from blockchain studies. The systematic literature review identified 262 relevant documents, after which a thematic content analysis was performed. Conceptual blockchain literature was identified to propose blockchain benefits for the real estate sector in four categories: land administration, real estate transactions, tokenization, and real estate management. The thematic content analysis also identified 26 empirical applications, of which all except one were related to land administration. Although the conceptual and theoretical blockchain literature presents blockchain as a disruptive and transformative technology for the real estate sector, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain adoption materializes more in hybrid, smaller-scale settings, where blockchain is merely an add-on layer to existing systems. Overall, most of the conceptual blockchain benefits remain empirically unconfirmed. On the other hand, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain could, for example, increase efficiency, reduce time, and provide verifiability, transparency, and automation, even in smaller-scale, hybrid settings. In addition, the applications indicate that blockchain could, in some cases, help reduce fraud and increase security and trust compared with centralized digital solutions. Finally, the empirical insights emphasize the role of political will, regulatory framework, availability of reliable digital data, public{\textendash}private partnerships, and educational aspects in blockchain applications.},

The field survey conducted included 23 contractors, 19 consultants, and 15 owners. Seventy-three causes of delay were identified during the research. 76\% of the contractors and 56\% of the consultants indicated that average of time overrun is between 10\% and 30\% of the original duration. The most common cause of delay identified by all the three parties is ``change order''. Surveys concluded that 70\% of projects experienced time overrun and found that 45 out of 76 projects considered were delayed.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the recent development in audit technologies, i.e., the rise of Big Data and Analytics (BDA) tools, and how auditors make use of them in audits. While prior audit studies have acknowledged that audit technologies shape and re-construct the market for audit services, they have not devoted much attention to the performative nature of such technologies and how their properties may shape the dynamics of technological change. Drawing on sociomateriality literature as well as observations, documentary materials and 25 semi-structured interviews with individuals directly engaging with BDA, this study explores how BDA users interact with particular properties of the technology in the course of an audit. We then consider how these interactions reconfigure aspects of the audit process and change the relational dynamics within audit firms. In particular, our findings suggest that properties of BDA such as scripts have afforded large-scale automation of audit routines, generating opportunities for expanding the evidential scope and depth of audit work. Further, we also show how the visualization dashboards have contributed to auditors' ability to communicate and justify their claims and judgements. Finally, we demonstrate that BDA has reshaped the nature of work relationships and flows between audit firms' different functions and service lines.},

An important source for this interpretation is how the term was applied in previous court cases. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 in generating factually accurate, clear and relevant explanations of terms in legislation. We compare the performance of a baseline setup, where GPT-4 is directly asked to explain a legal term, to an augmented approach, where a legal information retrieval module is used to provide relevant context to the model, in the form of sentences from case law. We found that the direct application of GPT-4 yields explanations that appear to be of very high quality on their surface. However, detailed analysis uncovered limitations in terms of the factual accuracy of the explanations. Further, we found that the augmentation leads to improved quality, and appears to eliminate the issue of hallucination, where models invent incorrect statements. These findings open the door to the building of systems that can autonomously retrieve relevant sentences from case law and condense them into a useful explanation for legal scholars, educators or practicing lawyers alike.},

Continuous technological advancements such as statistical computing and large language models allow for an increasingly natural and effortless interaction, as well as domain-agnostic deployment opportunities. Ultimately, this evolution begs multiple questions: How have technical capabilities developed? How is the nature of work changed through humans' interaction with conversational agents? How has research framed dominant perceptions and depictions of such agents? And what is the path forward? To address these questions, we conducted a bibliometric study including over 5000 research articles on CAs. Based on a systematic analysis of keywords, topics, and author networks, we derive ``five waves of CA research'' that describe the past, present, and potential future of research on CAs. Our results highlight fundamental technical evolutions and theoretical paradigms in CA research. Therefore, we discuss the moderating role of big technologies, and novel technological advancements like OpenAI GPT or BLOOM NLU that mark the next frontier of CA research. We contribute to theory by laying out central research streams in CA research, and offer practical implications by highlighting the design and deployment opportunities of CAs.},

  abstract = {With the increasing number and complexity of legal obligations, ensuring business process compliance presents a major challenge for today's organizations. In this regard, implementing a set of control means and regularly auditing their effectiveness are suitable measures to ensure a compliant design and enactment of a business process. However, common business process modeling languages (PML) do not provide appropriate concepts to comprehensively model such control means. Not surprisingly, common PMLs are not widely used in the audit domain. To address this gap, this paper presents an extension of a PML with modeling concepts for process-integrated control means. As it is based on previous empirical research with auditors, the extension especially considers their requirements. The results of a laboratory experiment with 78 participants demonstrate that the extension supports auditors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of internal controls in a process model compared to current audit practice.},

In this paper, we present an integrated approach to compliance management that helps process designers to adhere to compliance requirements relevant for their processes. Firstly, we introduce a conceptual model for specifying compliance requirements originating from various compliance sources. Secondly, we propose a framework for augmenting business processes with reusable fragments to ensure process compliance to certain requirements by design. Furthermore, we discuss the formalization of compliance requirements using mathematical logics and integrate the framework for process reuse with automated software verification tools.},

Some of these issues could be resolved by realizing the integration of BP modeling standards with business vocabularies and rules. The paper presents some argumentation to back such statements.

  abstract = {Knowledge production within the field of business research is accelerating at a tremendous speed while at the same time remaining fragmented and interdisciplinary. This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper. It also discusses common pitfalls and how to get literature reviews published.},

In analyzing employees, FES consists of nine factors; however, those nine factors are considered to be insufficient. Hence, the researchers used the process mining method to improve FES. Process mining analyzes job performance in details. The steps taken in process mining consist of time stamp, case, activity, and resources of employee. This means that the method can be continuously used, since the researcher provides weight for each factor. The weight of each factor is obtained from Analytic Hierarchy Process-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. The result shows that FES with process mining are good for job performance but AHP-TOPSIS is considered to be incompatible for usage compared to the real work because the priority of the FES factors from the method is inconsistent with the priority factor made by manager of the warehouse officer.},

Data-centric approaches set their focus on data, aiming at supporting data-intensive business processes and increased process flexibility. The objective of this article is to gain profound insights into the maturity of different data-centric approaches as well as their capabilities. In particular, this article will provide a framework for systematically evaluating and comparing data-centric approaches, with regard to the phases of the business process lifecycle. To this end, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted with the goal of evaluating the capabilities of data-centric process management approaches. The SLR comprises 38 primary studies which were thoroughly analyzed. The studies were categorized into different approaches, whose capabilities were thoroughly assessed. Special focus was put on the tooling and software of the approaches. The article provides the empirically grounded DALEC framework to evaluate and compare data-centric approaches. Furthermore, the results of the SLR offer insights into existing data-centric approaches and their capabilities. Data-centric approaches promise better support of loosely structured and data-intensive business processes, which may not be adequately represented by activity-centric paradigms.},

Industry solutions offer tagging mechanisms to map regulations to operational specifics; however, they are mostly semi-formal in nature and tend to rely extensively on experts. We propose to use Semantics of Business Vocabularies and Rules along with similarity measures to create an explicit mapping between concepts of regulations and models of operational specifics of the enterprise.

Sophisticated financial statement users (financial analysts and professional accountants) and less sophisticated financial statement users (MBA students) extracted information from a set of financial statements that included an income statement either in the IAS 1 format or in the matrix format. We find that the matrix format improves the accuracy with which users extract financial information. This result is driven by greater accuracy, for all users groups, on `below-the-line' items. Furthermore, despite lack of familiarity with the matrix format, its use does not appear to affect the time taken, the ease of extracting financial information, or users' task completion confidence. These findings may assist the FASB and IASB in their joint project on financial statement presentation.},

  abstract = {Risk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) has been addressed in research since more than a decade. However, the integration of the two independent research streams is still ongoing with a lack of research focusing on the conceptual modeling perspective. Such an integration results in an increased meta-model complexity and a higher entry barrier for modelers in creating conceptual models and for addressees of the models in comprehending them. Multi-view modeling can reduce this complexity by providing multiple interdependent viewpoints that, all together, represent a complex system. Each viewpoint only covers those concepts that are necessary to separate the different concerns of stakeholders. However, adopting multi-view modeling discloses a number of challenges particularly related to managing consistency which is threatened by semantic and syntactic overlaps between the viewpoints. Moreover, usability and efficiency of multi-view modeling have never been systematically evaluated. This paper reports on the conceptualization, implementation, and empirical evaluation of e-BPRIM, a multi-view modeling extension of the Business Process-Risk Management-Integrated Method (BPRIM). The findings of our research contribute to theory by showing, that multi-view modeling outperforms diagram-oriented modeling by means of usability and efficiency of modeling, and quality of models. Moreover, the developed modeling tool is openly available, allowing its adoption and use in R-BPM practice. Eventually, the detailed presentation of the conceptualization serves as a blueprint for other researchers aiming to harness multi-view modeling.},

For Conceptual modeling we use Object-role modeling (ORM), a fact-oriented approach for modeling information at a conceptual level. For process modeling we use a technique (workflow language) called Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL). YAWL works as an extension of Petri Nets with constructs to address the multiple instances, advanced synchronization and cancellation patterns.

  abstract = {Since their inception in 1962, Petri nets have been used in a wide variety of application domains. Although Petri nets are graphical and easy to understand, they have formal semantics and allow for analysis techniques ranging from model checking and structural analysis to process mining and performance analysis. Over time Petri nets emerged as a solid foundation for Business Process Management (BPM) research. The BPM discipline develops methods, techniques, and tools to support the design, enactment, management, and analysis of operational business processes. Mainstream business process modeling notations and workflow management systems are using token-based semantics borrowed from Petri nets. Moreover, state-of-the-art BPM analysis techniques are using Petri nets as an internal representation. Users of BPM methods and tools are often not aware of this. This paper aims to unveil the seminal role of Petri nets in BPM.},

The model may have been constructed by hand or may have been discovered. Moreover, the model may be normative or descriptive. Conformance checking relates events in the event log to activities in the process model and compares both. The goal is to find commonalities and discrepancies between the modeled behavior and the observed behavior. Conformance checking is relevant for business alignment and auditing. For example, the event log can be replayed on top of the process model to find undesirable deviations suggesting fraud or inefficiencies. Moreover, conformance checking techniques can also be used for measuring the performance of process discovery algorithms and to repair models that are not aligned well with reality.},

On the one hand, some process mining techniques build on classical data mining techniques, e.g., discovery and enhancement approaches focusing on data and resources. On the other hand, ideas originating from the data mining field will be used for the evaluation of process mining results. For example, one can adopt various data mining approaches to measure the quality of the discovered or enhanced process models. Existing data mining techniques are of little use for control-flow discovery, conformance checking, and other process mining tasks. Nevertheless, a~basic understanding of data mining is most helpful for fully understanding the process mining techniques presented in subsequent chapters.},

It can be viewed as an amalgamation of classical disciplines like statistics, data mining, databases, and distributed systems. Existing approaches need to be combined to turn abundantly available data into value for individuals, organizations, and society. Moreover, new challenges have emerged, not just in terms of size (``Big Data'') but also in terms of the questions to be answered. This book focuses on the analysis of behavior based on event data. Process mining techniques use event data to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, compare process variants, and suggest improvements. In later chapters, we will show that process mining provides powerful tools for today's data scientist. However, before introducing the main topic of the book, we provide an overview of the data science discipline.},

When merging and extracting data, both syntax and semantics play an important role. Moreover, depending on the questions one seeks to answer, different views on the available data are needed. Process mining, like any other data-driven analysis approach, needs to deal with data quality problems. We discuss typical data quality challenges encountered in reality.

Timestamps and frequencies of activities can be used to identify bottlenecks and diagnose other performance related problems.

Obviously, it is not possible to influence the execution of ``post mortem'' cases. Moreover, cases that are still in the pipeline cannot be guided on the basis of ``post mortem'' event data only. Today, however, many data sources are updated in (near) real-time and sufficient computing power is available to analyze events when they occur. Therefore, process mining should not be restricted to off-line analysis and can also be used for online operational support. This chapter broadens the scope of process mining to include online decision support. For example, for a running case the remaining flow time can be predicted and suitable actions can be recommended to minimize costs.},

Despite the growing capabilities of modern computing infrastructures, event logs may be too large or too complex to be handled using conventional approaches. This chapter focuses on handling ``Big Event Data'' and relates process mining to Big Data technologies. Moreover, it is shown that process mining problems can be decomposed in two ways, case-based decomposition and activity-based decomposition. Many of the analysis techniques described can be made scalable using such decompositions. Also other performance-related topics such as streaming process mining and process cubes are discussed. The chapter shows that the lion's share of process mining techniques can be ``applied in the large'' by using the right infrastructure and approach.},

Mainstream data mining and machine learning tools provide more sophisticated forms of analysis, but are also not tailored towards the analysis and improvement of processes. Fortunately, there are dedicated process mining tools able to transform event data into actionable process-related insights. For example, ProM is an open-source process mining tool supporting all of the techniques mentioned in this book. Process discovery, conformance checking, social network analysis, organizational mining, clustering, decision mining, prediction, and recommendation are all supported by ProM plug-ins. However, the usability of the hundreds of available plug-ins varies and the complexity of the tool may be overwhelming for end-users. In recent years, several vendors released dedicated process mining tools (e.g., Celonis, Disco, EDS, Fujitsu, Minit, myInvenio, Perceptive, PPM, QPR, Rialto, and SNP). These tools typically provide less functionality than ProM, but are easier to use while focusing on data extraction, performance analysis and scalability. This chapter provides an overview of available tools and trends.},

  abstract = {Government agencies are becoming more data-driven and need high-quality data to fulfill their roles in society. In the past, each agency organized its own data exchange system according to its own needs. Today, data is distributed over many organizations, and government agencies need to adopt an ecosystem approach for data exchange. Fundamental in the ecosystem approach is the dependence on other parties for the execution of stewardship strategies. Data-driven government agencies increasingly depend on other organizations for highquality data and data stewardship across organizations is becoming more critical. While there is ample research on data stewardship within organizations, little is known about data stewardship in ecosystems. More specifically, it is unclear which data stewardship strategies government agencies can employ in ecosystems. The main goal of this explorative paper is to identify and compare data stewardship strategies used in empirical government-business ecosystems. Following an explorative case study approach, this paper reveals three different configurations of inter-organizational data stewardship: 1) the government-led ecosystem, 2) the government-business-led ecosystem, and 3) the regulation-led ecosystem. The case studies expose a wide array of data stewardship strategies across ecosystems. While the ecosystem approach provides advantages such as costsharing and innovation by private parties, government agencies become increasingly dependent on private parties to gain high-quality data and provide distributed infrastructure components. Maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks of the ecosystem approach requires government agencies to be cautious when selecting a specific ecosystem configuration.},

The system relies on cloud-computing technologies to provide online access to interactive environments containing all the tools, documentation, input and output models to reproduce alleged research results. The system also enables one to clone such an environment and add additional models or tools in order to extend a contribution or pinpoint a problem. In retrospect, we observe that the approach is not limited to software modeling and SHARE is in fact gaining acceptance in other fields already.},

Researchers have used various maturity models to investigate the development of a business process orientation (BPO), and most have argued that such development comes in stages. Current literature underestimates the interrelationships between BPO capabilities and fails to consider multidimensional or non-linear paths to maturity. To refine the features of maturity models, we rely on configuration theory to uncover different archetypes for BPO development and quantitatively evaluate them by examining performance differences among archetypes based on a large-scale international dataset. The resulting empirical taxonomy with seven BPO archetypes establishes important performance differences between organizations at a similar maturity level. Besides strengthening the theoretical foundations of BPO and making maturity assessments more multifaceted, our results help organizations focus their managerial efforts by enabling comparison with peers in the same archetype and showing various paths for BPO improvement.},

This paper proposes a set of high level concepts covering the GRC domain. Through literature review and framework research we propose key functions of governance, risk and compliance and their associations, resulting in a reference conceptual model for integrated GRC. The model was evaluated by comparing the GRC capability model from OCEG with a quality model evaluation framework. We concluded that the proposed model is valid and complete.},

The purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of project-ending competences needed in premature project closures. Two cases of premature project closure are analysed in different contexts: in the car industry and the aircraft manufacturing industry. The key findings concern the managerial challenges that are present in premature project closures: the need for involvement of senior and also project managers, the need to understand the often changed role of internal and external project stakeholders, and the need to understand that the `future matters' in premature project closure.},

Process science is based on four key principles; it (1) puts processes at the center of attention, (2) investigates processes scientifically, (3) embraces perspectives of multiple disciplines, and (4) aims to create impact by actively shaping the unfolding of processes. The ubiquitous availability of digital trace data, combined with advanced data analytics capabilities, offer new and unprecedented opportunities to study processes through multiple data sources, which makes process science very timely.},

Findings  {\textendash} The authors identify ten principles which represent a set of capabilities essential for mastering contemporary and future challenges in BPM.

This has put increasing pressure on banks to monitor and report a range of intricate exposures to comply with new prudential requirements. Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an emerging technology trend leveraging Information Technology and Digital Innovations that can greatly assist with a bank's regulatory management process. A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned. RegTech can provide an invaluable tool, in a business-as-usual environment, as well as in real-life stress events, such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak. This paper explores the potential of RegTech and the merit of incorporating it into a smart Treasury department.},

It requires disclosure of a large set of data points but does not provide aggregate measures. It is production-oriented and does not include accruals. It expands reporting to include disclosure of long-term policies and targets, and of information of firms in the value chain. Consequently, sustainability reporting is not very useful for tracking sustainability performance and for comparisons across firms. Overall, it would benefit from applying more generally accepted accounting concepts.},

  abstract = {In this qualitative study, we explore how incumbent firms in traditional industries build dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Digital transformation has been defined as the use of new digital technologies, such as mobile, artificial intelligence, cloud, blockchain, and the Internet of things (IoT) technologies, to enable major business improvements to augment customer experience, streamline operations, or create new business models. In making sense of digital transformation, we discovered that leaders in various industry circles use the term inconsistently to describe various strategizing and organizing activities; in addition, the term has gained limited scholarly attention as a context for study of strategic change. Drawing on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects at incumbent firms, we propose a process model comprising of nine microfoundations to reveal the generic contingency factors that trigger, enable, and hinder the building of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Our findings reveal that digital transformation is an ongoing process of using new digital technologies in everyday organizational life, which recognizes agility as the core mechanism for the strategic renewal of an organization's (1) business model, (2) collaborative approach, and eventually the (3) culture.},

Although Process Mining has been applied experimentally on micro-level workflow processes, it is not so easy to apply on the level of the value cycle that is at the core of accounting databases. A more general problem is that the new smart approaches lack a well-developed accounting ontology. The REA business ontology does offer such an ontology but so far, its main focus has been on accounting database design. In this paper, a Petri Net specification of REA is proposed for ontologybased process analysis. This specification makes it possible to express more than the traditional static specification. The paper also describes how REA Petri Nets can be developed using Process Mining and how they can be applied in a Continuous Auditing framework.},

  abstract = {A lean-agile model of homebuilders' production systems is proposed in this research. Value stream mapping is utilized to clarify the proposed lean-agile model, in which pull and Kanban are used to ensure smooth production upstream of the de-coupling point, while fluctuating market demands in terms of variety of homes and variability of volumes are managed by the agile process downstream of the de-coupling point. The de-coupling point is used to provide components to downstream agile process and shield upstream smooth production from market fluctuations. A simulation model is developed to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed lean-agile model. Simulation experiments show that the lean-agile model prevents the accumulation of high inventory levels and thus provides better customization opportunities for clients compared to even-flow-construction. It also provides a more stable process with shorter cycle times compared to sales-driven production. The proposed lean-agile model offers new possibilities for homebuilders to manage the balance between meeting fluctuating market demands and stabilizing the production system.

The availability of digital data opens up new opportunities for innovative audit procedures. Process mining can be used as a novel data analysis technique to support auditors in this context. Process mining algorithms produce process models by analyzing recorded event logs. Contemporary general purpose mining algorithms commonly use the temporal order of recorded events for determining the control flow in mined process models. The presented research shows how data dependencies related to the accounting structure of recorded events can be used as an alternative to the temporal order of events for discovering the control flow. The generated models provide accurate information on the control flow from an accounting perspective and show a lower complexity compared to those generated using timestamp dependencies. The presented research follows a design science research approach and uses three different real world data sets for evaluation purposes.},

  abstract = {Context Large organizations often run hundreds or even thousands of different business processes. Managing such large collections of business process models is a challenging task. Software can assist in performing that task, by supporting common management functions such as storage, search and version management of models. It can also provide advanced functions that are specific for managing collections of process models, such as managing the consistency of public and private processes. Software that supports the management of large collections of business process models is called: business process model repository software. Objective This paper contributes to the development of business process model repositories, by analyzing the state of the art. Method To perform the analysis a literature survey and a comparison of existing (business process model) repository technology is performed. Result The results of the state of the art analysis are twofold. First, a framework for business process model repositories is presented, which consists of a management model and a reference architecture. The management model lists the functionality that can be provided and the reference architecture presents the components that provide that functionality. Second, an analysis is presented of the extent to which existing business process model repositories implement the functionality from the framework. Conclusion The results presented in the paper are valuable as a comprehensive overview of business process model repository functionality. In addition they form a basis for a future research agenda. We conclude that existing repositories focus on traditional functionality rather than exploiting the full potential of information management tools, thus we show that there is a strong basis for further research.},

  abstract = {The Semantic Web is becoming increasingly important for information systems and significant progress has been made in recent years in developing new ideas and tools. As the demand for semantically enabled applications increases, a diverse range of semantic web technologies (SWT) have emerged with the purpose of supporting the development of more intelligent information systems. The evolution and emergence of SWT is mostly fragmented lacking solution blueprints and guidance for organizations in the pathway of adopting SWT to address pragmatic problems. As a result, a majority of the semantically enabled applications in production and development are confined in smaller and trivial use cases. Operations in a controlled and simulated environment are often assumed. In this thesis, we focused on the study of novel semantic-based techniques and tools for addressing the current challenges and needs in domain of Regulatory Compliance Auditing. Regulatory Compliance Auditing involves many pragmatic use cases with effect on broad range of important actors in organizations. These problems could be solved and supported by SWT. For example, if SWT are used to model regulatory policies that relates to the regulations, it would make it simpler and easier for organizations and legislators to add, delete, modify and manage regulations while facilitating audits in an efficient manner. Adopting SWT in Regulatory Compliance Auditing is not without challenges. We have identified and then proposed solutions to address the challenges and issues. Solutions materialized from this thesis include a Semantic-based Reasoning Framework (SemRRF) and an Ontology-based Robust Production System (OntoRPS) that involves SWT such as Ontologies, Semantic-based Rules, Fuzzy Logic and Production Systems. Furthermore, we have described and demonstrated the generic usage and real world application of our proposed semantic-based solution by implementing SemRRF and OntoRPS and presenting a case study for addressing IT security compliance. We aim to use our studies in the Regulatory Compliance Auditing domain as solution guidance for organizations with plans to adopt SWT on more pragmatic, complex and important real-world problems. Another objective is to pioneer research on semantic-based approach to the ubiquitous Regulatory Compliance problems.},

They define a common terminology and the requirements for improving food quality and safety, which are highly important in light of past and current food scandals. However, the rules that can be derived from regulations are scattered in legal texts that have to be processed manually to create a set of company-specific process controls. Current approaches lack an intermediate, domain-specific representation that fosters reuse and is technology-agnostic. In this paper, such a pattern-based approach is developed to formalize compliance requirements in the food industry. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it presents a pattern catalogue that is built on the basis of real-world legal documents. Second, it devises a transformation process that allows users to systematically capture compliance requirements from textual descriptions, to represent them in the form of patterns and, finally, to transform them into executable process controls.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Many researchers and practitioners suggest a contingent instead of a ``one size fits all'' approach in business process management (BPM). The purpose of this paper is to offer a contingency theory of BPM, which proposes contingency factors relevant to the successful management of business processes and that explains how and why these contingencies impact the relationships between process management and performance.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The authors develop the theory by drawing on organizational information processing theory (OIPT) and applying an information processing (IP) perspective to the process level.                                         Findings               The premise of the model is that the process management mechanisms such as documentation, standardization or monitoring must compensate for the uncertainty and equivocality of the nature of the process that has to be managed. In turn, managing through successful adaptation is a prerequisite for process performance.                                         Research limitations/implications               The theory provides a set of testable propositions that specify the relationship between process management mechanisms and process performance. The authors also discuss implications of the new theory for further theorizing and outline empirical research strategies that can be followed to enact, evaluate and extend the theory.                                         Practical implications               The theory developed in this paper allows an alternative way to describe organizational processes and supports the derivation of context-sensitive management approaches for process documentation, standardization, monitoring, execution and coordination.                                         Originality/value               The theoretical model is novel in that it provides a contextualized view on BPM that acknowledges different types of processes and suggests different mechanisms for managing these. The authors hope the paper serves as inspiration both for further theory development as well as to empirical studies that test, refute, support or otherwise augment the arguments.},

  abstract = {This paper examines systems development in a global collaborative community of high-energy physics and offers insights and implications for agile systems development in other large scale and distributed settings. The paper studies the ongoing construction of the UK's computing grid for particle physics (GridPP), a grid that is itself part of the world's largest grid, the Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid. We observe in this project a collective, agile and distributed performance through which the Grid is constructed. We express this through the concept of `collective agility' which captures a large distributed performance rather than the more conventional sense of agility as small-group and deliberate systems development practices. The collective agility of GridPP is analysed as a process of `enacted emergence' expressed through the dynamics of six improvisation paradoxes.},
