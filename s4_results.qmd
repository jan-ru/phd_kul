# Results2 {#sec-results}

Here are my results. I computed them with this formula:

$$ y = mx + b $$ {#eq-line}

I have plotted them in this figure:

![Amazing results of a line.](static/gear_box.jpg){#fig-line}

I have also listed some of the points on this line in the following table:

| X | Y |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |

Table: Results related to my line. {#tbl-line}

That was truly amazing.
In Section @sec-result, we saw all there was to see about lines.
First, in Equation @eq-line, we saw the deep Maths behind a line.
Second, we saw the most beautiful depiction of a line (Figure @fig-line).
Third, Table @tbl-line presented us, in all their glory, 
points to a line.
