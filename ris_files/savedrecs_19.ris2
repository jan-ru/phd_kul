AB  - Regulations are often written as open norms. Thus, the development of systems that support compliance involves interpretation. Often, compliance officers consider several alternative solutions. Comparing the feasibility and deciding which alternative to select are important tasks. In this paper, we aim to show how analyzing the impact of several interpretation can be supported by requirements engineering tools, in particular, by LEGAL-URN. Two cases are used to illustrate the importance of interpretation and how LEGAL-URN facilitates it.

AB  - Any enterprise must ensure that its business processes comply with imposed compliance rules. The latter stem, for example, from corporate guidelines, legal regulations, and best practices. In general, a compliance rule may constrain multiple perspectives of a business process, including behavior (i.e. control flow), data, time, resources, and interactions with business partners. As a particular challenge, compliance cannot be completely ensured at design time, but needs to be continuously monitored during process enactment as well, i.e., it has to be dynamically checked whether compliance rules are satisfied or temporarily/permanently violated. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for visually monitoring business process compliance. As opposed to existing approaches, the framework supports the visual monitoring of all relevant process perspectives based on the extended Compliance Rule Graph (eCRG) language. Furthermore, it not only allows for the detection of violations, but additionally highlights their causes. Finally, the framework assists users in both monitoring business process compliance and ensuring the compliant continuation of running business processes. Overall, the framework provides a fundamental contribution towards the real-time monitoring of compliance in process driven enterprises.

AB  - Today's enterprises demand a high degree of compliance of business processes to meet regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and Basel I-III. To ensure continuous guaranteed compliance, compliance management should be considered during all phases of the business process lifecycle; from the analysis and design to deployment, monitoring and evaluation. This paper introduces an integrated business process compliance management framework that incorporates design-time verification and runtime monitoring approaches. The nutshell of the approach is the Compliance Request Language (CRL), which is a high-level pattern-based language for the abstract specification of compliance requirements. From CRL expressions, formal compliance rules can be automatically generated, thereby eliminating the need for business and compliance experts to learn and use complex low-level formal languages. Formalized compliance rules enable automated approaches to be used for the static verification and dynamic monitoring of business processes. An integrated prototypical tool-suite is developed as a proof-of-concept to help validating the applicability of the approaches, and validated by experiment with two real-life case studies.

AB  - Legal compliance is an important part of certifying the correct behaviour of a business process. To be compliant, organizations might hard-wire regulations into processes, limiting the discretion that workers have when choosing what activities should be executed in a case. Worse, hard-wired compliant processes are difficult to change when laws change, and this occurs very often. This paper proposes a model-driven approach to process compliance and combines a) reference models from laws, and b) business process models. Both reference and process models are expressed in a declarative process language, The Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) graphs. They are subject to testing and verification, allowing law practitioners to check consistency against the intent of the law. Compliance checking is a combination of alignments between events in laws and events in a process model. In this way, a reference model can be used to check different process variants. Moreover, changes in the reference model due to law changes do not necessarily invalidate existing processes, allowing their reuse and adaptation. We exemplify the framework via the alignment of laws and business rules and a real contract change management process, Finally, we show how compliance checking for declarative processes is decidable, and provide a polynomial time approximation that contrasts NP complexity algorithms used in compliance checking for imperative business processes. All-together, this paper presents technical and methodological steps that are being used by legal practitioners in municipal governments in their efforts towards digitalization of work practices in the public sector.

AB  - Today's enterprises demand a high degree of compliance of business processes to meet diverse regulations and legislations. Several industrial studies have shown that compliance management is a daunting task, and organizations are still struggling and spending billions of dollars annually to ensure and prove their compliance. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive compliance management framework with a main focus on design-time compliance management as a first step towards a preventive lifetime compliance support. The framework enables the automation of compliance-related activities that are amenable to automation, and therefore can significantly reduce the expenditures spent on compliance. It can help experts to carry out their work more efficiently, cut the time spent on tedious manual activities, and reduce potential human errors. An evident candidate compliance activity for automation is the compliance checking, which can be achieved by utilizing formal reasoning and verification techniques. However, formal languages are well known of their complexity as only versed users in mathematical theories and formal logics are able to use and understand them. However, this is generally not the case with business and compliance practitioners. Therefore, in the heart of the compliance management framework, we introduce the Compliance Request Language (CRL), which is formally grounded on temporal logic and enables the abstract pattern-based specification of compliance requirements. CRL constitutes a series of compliance patterns that spans three structural facets of business processes; control flow, employed resources and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, CRL supports the specification of compensations and non-monotonic requirements, which permit the relaxation of some compliance requirements to handle exceptional situations. An integrated tool suite has been developed as an instantiation artefact, and the validation of the approach is undertaken in several directions, which includes internal validity, controlled experiments, and functional testing.

AB  - Following the crisis in 2008, different industrial sectors has faced growing numbers of laws and regulations globally. The number and complexity of these regulations is creating significant issues for governance, risk and compliance management especially for heavily-regulated sectors, such as the financial industry. This paper proposes a semantically-enabled compliance management framework that backs up the entire business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design-time verification, runtime and offline monitoring and analysis. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating domain, business and regulatory knowledge, at different levels of abstraction, which provides a shared conceptualization of the interrelated compliance and business specifics. Furthermore, given the technological revolution caused by cloud computing, we draw our vision on providing compliance-related ontologies as a service (COaaS) on the cloud. As an initial validation step, we have considered the financial sector with an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) case study and applied our semantic-based approach on.

AB  - Today's dynamically changing business and compliance environment demand enterprises to continuously ensure their compliance with various laws, regulations and standards. Several business studies have concluded that compliance management is one of the main challenges companies face nowadays. Runtime compliance monitoring is of utmost importance for compliance assurance as during the prior design-time compliance checking phase, only a subset of the imposed compliance requirements can be statically checked due to the absence of required variable instantiation and contextual information. Furthermore, the fact that a BP model has been statically checked for compliance during design-time does not guarantee that the corresponding running BP instances are usually compliant due to human and machine errors. In this paper, we present a generic proactive runtime BP compliance monitoring framework, BP-MaaS. The framework incorporates a wide range of expressive high-level graphical compliance patterns for the abstract specification of runtime constraints. Compliance monitoring is achieved using anti-patterns, a novel mechanism which is agnostic towards any underlying monitoring execution technology. As a proof-of-concept, complex event processing (CEP) technology is adopted as one of the possible realizations of the monitoring engine of the framework. An integrated tool-suite has been developed as an instantiation artifact of BP-MaaS, and the validation of the approach is undertaken in several directions, which includes internal validity and case study conducts considering two real-life case studies from the banking domain.

AB  - Business process compliance (BPC) denotes business processes that adhere to requirements originating from different sources, e.g., laws or regulations. Compliance measures are used in business processes to prevent compliance violations and their consequences, such as fines or monetary sanctions. Compliance measures also incur costs, e.g., for tools, hardware, or personnel. To ensure that companies can work economically even in intensively regulated environments, the economic viability of BPC has to be taken into account. A body of literature is already devoted to the economic assessment of processes and focuses on the business perspective, whereas corresponding approaches for BPC appear to be lacking. Consequently, we introduce a novel approach that allows for an economic assessment of process-based compliance measures. The approach takes monetary consequences of compliance violations into account and is based on the well-known basic workflow patterns for control flows. We demonstrate its applicability by means of an exemplary ordering process affected by Article 32 (1) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

AB  - Purpose - In organizations, individual user's compliance with business processes is important from a regulatory and efficiency point of view. The restriction of users' choices by implementing a restrictive information system is a typical approach in many organizations. However, restrictions and mandated compliance may affect employees' performance negatively. Especially when users need a certain degree of flexibility in completing their work activity. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of directive explanations (DEs). DEs provide context-dependent feedback to users, but do not force users to comply.
   Design/methodology/approach - The experimental study used in this paper aims at investigating how DEs influence users' process compliance. The authors used a laboratory experiment to test the proposed hypotheses. Every participant underwent four trials for which business process compliance was measured. Two trial blocks were used to cluster the four trials. Diagrammatic DEs were provided in one of the trial blocks, while textual DEs were provided in the other. Trial blocks were counterbalanced.
   Findings - The results of the experiment show that DEs influence a user's compliance, but the effect varies for different types of DEs. The authors believe this study is significant as it empirically examines design characteristics of explanations from knowledge-based systems in the context of business processes.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is certainly not without limitations. The sample used for this study was drawn from undergraduate information systems management students. The sample is thus not representative of the general population of organizations' IT users. However, a student sample adequately represents novice IT users, who are not very familiar with a business process. They are particularly suitable to study how users react to first-time contact with a DE.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study are important to designers and implementers of systems that guide users to follow business processes. As the authors have illustrated with a real-world scenario, an ERP system's explanation can lack details on how a user can resolve a blocked activity. In situations in which users bypass restricted systems, DEs can guide them to comply with a business process. Particularly diagrammatic explanations, which depict actors, activities, and constraints for a business process, have been found to increase the probability that users' behavior is business process compliant. Less time may be needed to resolve a situation, which can result in very efficient user-system cooperation.
   Originality/value - This study makes several important contributions to research on explanations, which are provided by knowledge-based systems. First, the authors conceptualized, designed, and investigated a novel type of explanations, namely, DEs. The results of this study show how dramatic the difference in process compliance performance is when exposed to certain types of DEs (in one group from 57 percent on the initial trial to 82 percent on the fourth trial). This insight is important to derive design guidelines for DE, particularly when multimedia material is used.

TI  - Why Do Banks Find Business Process Compliance so Challenging? An Australian Perspective
T2  - BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT FORUM
LA  - English
CP  - 20th International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) / Business Process Management (BPM) Forum
AB  - Banks play an intrinsic role in any modern economy, recycling capital from savers to borrowers. They are heavily regulated and there have been a significant number of well publicized compliance failings in recent years. This is despite Business Process Compliance (BPC) being both a well researched domain in academia and one where significant progress has been made. This study seeks to determine why Australian banks find BPC so challenging. We interviewed 22 senior managers from a range of functions within the four major Australian banks to identify the key challenges. Not every process in every bank is facing the same issues, but in processes where a bank is particularly challenged to meet its compliance requirements, the same themes emerge. The compliance requirement load they bear is excessive, dynamic and complex. Fulfilling these requirements relies on impenetrable spaghetti processes, and the case for sustainable change remains elusive, locking banks into a fail-fix cycle that increases the underlying complexity. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that identifies and aggregates the challenges, and a circuit-breaker approach as an "off ramp" to the fail-fix cycle.

AB  - Business process compliance is an essential part of business process management, which saves organizations from penalties caused by non-compliant processes. However, current researches on business process compliance mainly focus on checking using general constraint rules that have been formalized without in-depth analysis of related regulatory documents and mostly involve extensive human efforts. In this paper, we aim to propose an automatic and interpretable compliance checking approach for design-time business processes. By combining deep learning and a natural language processing approach based on rule templates, we extract semantic information from regulatory documents at different granularities for subsequent compliance checking. In addition, we match appropriate rules to the process model and detect the degree of violation of the business process from three control-flow perspectives.

TI  - Runtime Detection of Business Process Compliance Violations: An Approach based on Anti Patterns
T2  - 30TH ANNUAL ACM SYMPOSIUM ON APPLIED COMPUTING, VOLS I AND II

CP  - 30th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC)
AB  - Today's enterprises demand a high degree of compliance in their business processes to meet diverse regulations and legislations. Several industrial studies have shown that compliance management is a daunting task, and organizations are still struggling and spending billions of dollars annually to ensure and prove their compliance. Theoretically, design-time compliance checking could provide a preliminary assurance that corresponding running instances would be compliant to relevant laws and regulations; however, due to the existence of human and machine related errors and the absence of necessary contextual information during design-time, runtime compliance monitoring becomes a must. In this paper, we present a generic proactive runtime Business Process (BP) compliance monitoring framework: BP-MaaS, which incorporates a wide range of expressive high-level compliance patterns for the abstract specification of runtime constraints. Compliance monitoring is achieved by means of anti-patterns, a novel evaluation approach that is independent of any underlying technology and could be applied to the checking of compliance in the different phases of the BP lifecycle. As a proof-of-concept, complex event processing (CEP) technology is adopted as one of the possible realizations of the framework.

AB  - Nowadays enterprises are searching the efficient compliance management method. Being compliant could potentially help capturing the most important information, using practice and existing process solutions; thus reducing the management effort and cost. When it comes to the security compliance management, it means treating and reducing the security risks to the acceptable level and employing the validated and cost effective security countermeasures. However, the typical question that small and medium enterprises face, is on how to achieve the security compliance in the efficient way. In this paper we report on our experience to use the security risk-oriented patterns to improve business processes of the insurance brokerage. The analysed case showed the major steps to apply the regulatory standard to check compliance, as well as the major procedures needed to improve the business process compliance. The lessons learnt highlight some method guidelines toward compliance management and suggest needed improvement directions for the application of the security risk-oriented patterns.

KW  - Business Rule Management
KW  - Business Process Compliance
KW  - Business Rule Lifecycle
AB  - In the scope of Business Process Compliance (BPC), business rules are used as a central means to represent regulatory policies and consequently to (automatically) verify, whether business process models abide by respective rules. While there has been a plethora of works regarding this actual verification of process models relative to business rules, we see a strong lack of works regarding the actual creation and maintenance of business rules. More precisely, many works assume sound sets of business rules as a basis for subsequent techniques. However, recent works suggest this assumption cannot be made in practice, and companies actually need to be supported in the scope of managing and organizing business rules, e. g. to remove redundant or contradictory rules. Otherwise, errors in business rules make these rule bases unusable and impede a subsequent verification of process compliance. Yet, the understanding on business rule organization is sparse - especially its relation to BPC. To address this issue on a conceptual level, we develop a taxonomy for business rule organizing approaches. Furthermore, we identify rule organizing approaches from literature based on a systematic literature review and classify these works in the scope of the developed taxonomy. Based on the identified literature, we also identify research gaps and propose a corresponding research agenda.

AB  - Business process compliance is one of the prevalent challenges for companies. Despite an abundance of research proposals, companies still struggle with manual compliance checks and the understanding of compliance violations in the light of missing root-cause explanations. Moreover, approaches have merely focused on the control flow perspective in compliance checking, neglecting other aspects such as the data perspective. This paper aims at analyzing the gap between existing academic work and compliance demands from practice with a focus on the data aspects. The latter emerges from a small set of regulatory documents from different domains. Patterns are assumed as the right level of abstraction for compliance specification due to their independence of (technical) implementation in (process-aware) information systems, potential for reuse, and understandability. A systematic literature review collects and assesses existing compliance patterns. A first analysis of ten regulatory documents from different domains specifically reveals data-oriented compliance constraints that are not yet reflected by existing compliance patterns. Accordingly, data-related compliance patterns are specified.

AB  - Literature on business process compliance (BPC) has predominantly focused on the alignment of the regulatory rules with the design, verification and validation of business processes. Previously, surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches and categorises them based on different compliance management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000 and 2015. The survey results reveal that mostly compliance management approaches centre around three distinct categories, namely design-time (28%), run-time (32%) and auditing (10%). Also, organisational and internal control-based compliance management frameworks (21%) and hybrid approaches make (9%) of the surveyed approaches. Furthermore, open research challenges and gaps are identified and discussed with respect to the compliance problem.

TI  - Towards Supporting Business Process Compliance Checking with Compliance Pattern Catalogues A Financial Industry Case Study
T2  - ENTERPRISE MODELLING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Business process compliance checking serves to discover legal or self-regulatory violations in business processes using process models. This way, companies can react to new regulations and avoid violations quickly, hence prevent negative monetary or even legal consequences. In the business process compliance management literature, we find an abundance of approaches supporting business process compliance checking. Although many of these approaches show promise to support business process compliance checking by providing model checking-like methodologies, hardly any of them provide a common list of relevant compliance rules or violations that should be checked for. With this paper, we aim at making a step towards comprehensive catalogues of compliance rules that can be used as input for business process compliance checking approaches. In particular, we analyse two legal documents providing a set of compliance rules for service processes in financial industries. We derive compliance patterns from them and apply them to a large business process model coming from a German IT service provider for banks, using a graph pattern-based compliance checking approach. As a result, we show that deriving business process compliance rules from legal texts leads to meaningful patterns matching several subsections of common process models of financial services. Hence, we can expect catalogues of such patterns to be promising for supporting business process analysts in compliance checking.

AB  - Despite the great benefits of cloud computing on businesses, some organizations have had to withdraw from its service due to incomplete compliance to conditions from standards, bodies, or Service Level Agreements which have led to their being penalized. A structured and efficient model is helpful to aid small and medium scale enterprises (SMSEs) utilize cloud services safely and ascertain their fitting into necessary requirements before adoption. In this paper, a compliance management architecture is proposed to efficiently aid SMSE efficiently validate and examine at the time of design and running their business process. The verification of the model will be done using SPIN model checker based on linear temporal logic rules. The network analysis approach is proposed for monitoring the models at run time. The presented approach will allow for effective coordination of SMSE business adherence to any domain regulatory requirements. It will also allow for update with new requirements.

AB  - Given the strong increase in regulatory requirements for business processes the management of business process compliance becomes a more and more regarded field in IS research. Several methods have been developed to support compliance checking of conceptual models. However, their focus on distinct modeling languages and mostly linear (i.e., predecessor-successor related) compliance rules may hinder widespread adoption and application in practice. Furthermore, hardly any of them has been evaluated in a real-world setting. We address this issue by applying a generic pattern matching approach for conceptual models to business process compliance checking in the financial sector. It consists of a model query language, a search algorithm and a corresponding modelling tool prototype. It is (1) applicable for all graph-based conceptual modeling languages and (2) for different kinds of compliance rules. Furthermore, based on an applicability check, we (3) evaluate the approach in a financial industry project setting against its relevance for decision support of audit and compliance management tasks.
