For dataquality maybe plot articles (vertical) and fields filled (horizontal). Articles could be grouped by author or by itemtype or by journal.
Probably easier/quicker to use JabRef to check dataquality (or biber)

Look up terminology:

- Scientometrics
- informetrics

Ref journal ISSI

For dataquality biber can likely be used as it issues warnings and errors and it has a check datamodel flag.
