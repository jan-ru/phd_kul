## Background

In the context of the DBA program at Vlerick Business School a literature review is one of the deliverables of year two.
(Question: can we use the model published by OCEG? (@RegulatoryChangeManagement2018))

## Research questions

The main research question RQ

RQ: What are approaches for aligning business processes with regulatory requirements to achieve regulatory compliance by design?

SQ-1: How can businesses identify relevant regulatory requirements? 

SQ-2: How can businesses analyze which business processes are affected by changes in requlatory requirements? 

SQ-3: How can businesses integrate compliance requirements into business process design?

SQ-4: How can businesses ensure compliance throughout the lifecycle of the impacted business processes?

Search strings

I want to expand the number of SLR to 10 by including SLR's from A-star journals in the BPM/IS field(s).

To demonstrate International Research Collaboration (IRC), "using affiliations listed in publications has become the standard practice" [](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/3/3/529/112967/Assessing-the-quality-of-bibliographic-data). I would like to use this to show the affiliations of the authors of the articles included in my literature research.

Concepts mentioned in the article:

- Data quality (DQ) and Data quality assessment (DQA)
- Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)
- Zotero Data quality dimensions (DQDs)

In the article above DQ is split into:

- Intrinsic Data Quality (4 attributes)
- Contextual Data Quality (5 attributes)
- Representational Data Quality (4 attributes)
- Accessibility Data Quality (2 attributes)

Note: in this study Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) is one of the four datasources considered. MAG has since been [retired](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/).

## Examples of SLR

[05/10/2023] Looking in my Zotero library for articles with a title that contains "systematic literature review", the result is 7 hits:

- The first is @kitchenhamGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007 and there is a duplicate @keeleGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007.
- Second there are 3 SLR's where Van Looy is co-author (@moreno-montesdeocaSystematicLiteratureReview2015, @prodanovaHowBeneficialSocial2019, @ahmadBusinessProcessManagement2020).
- There is 1 SLR about BPMN extentions (@zarourSystematicLiteratureReview2019)
- Finally, there is one SLR about Open Science (@VICENTESAEZ2018428) which is not relevant to BP4RC.
