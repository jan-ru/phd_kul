# Systematic Literature Review

## My Zotero Library
[05/07/2023] Looking in my Zotero library for articles with a title that contains "systematic literature review", the result is 7 hits.

The first is @kitchenhamGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007 and there is a duplicate @keeleGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007. Second there are 3 SLR's where Van Looy is co-author (@moreno-montesdeocaSystematicLiteratureReview2015, @ahmadBusinessProcessManagement2020, @prodanovaHowBeneficialSocial2019). There is 1 SLR about BPMN extentions (@zarourSystematicLiteratureReview2019) Finally, there is one SLR about Open Science (@VICENTESAEZ2018428) which is not relevant to BP4RC.


** Create Zotero(?) report whereby I get abstract, methodology etc. of paper.

** How to reference multiple papers? - numeric method **
## Need for SLR

This SLR is undertaken as a sprelude to further research.

• What are the review’s objectives?
• What sources were searched to identify primary studies? Were there any restrictions?
• What were the inclusion/exclusion criteria and how were they applied? • What criteria were used to assess the quality of primary studies? • How were quality criteria applied? 
• How were the data extracted from the primary studies? 
• How were the data synthesised? 
• How were differences between studies investigated? 
• How were the data combined? 
• Was it reasonable to combine the studies? 
• Do the conclusions flow from the evidence?

## Commissioning Document

A4 in attachment (not required for PhD students ref pag 9 of Kitchenham)
• Project Title 
• Background 
• Review Questions
• Advisory/Steering Group Membership (Researchers, Practitioners, Lay members, Policy Makers etc) 
• Methods of the review 
• Project Timetable 
• Dissemination Strategy

• References

## Research questions

RQ-1: What are the  for aligning business processes with regulatory requirements to achieve regulatory compliance by design?

Search strings

I want to expand the number of SLR to 10 by including SLR's from A-star journals in the BPM/IS field(s).

To demonstrate International Research Collaboration (IRC), "using affiliations listed in publications has become the standard practice" [](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/3/3/529/112967/Assessing-the-quality-of-bibliographic-data). I would like to use this to show the affiliations of the authors of the articles included in my literature research.

Concepts mentioned in the article:
- Data quality (DQ) and Data quality assessment (DQA)
- Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)
- Zotero Data quality dimensions (DQDs)

In the article above DQ is split into:
- Intrinsic Data Quality (4 attributes)
- Contextual Data Quality (5 attributes)
- Representational Data Quality (4 attributes)
- Accessibility Data Quality (2 attributes)

Note: in this study Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) is one of the four datasources considered. MAG has since been [retired](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/).
