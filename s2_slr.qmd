## Background

In the context of the DBA program at Vlerick Business School a literature review is one of the deliverables of year two.

## Conceptual model

There is an existing model published by OCEG (&Refentiv) that may be used as a reference. The 2018 version is attached and redrawn below (@RegulatoryChangeManagement2018).

{{< include tables/s2_oceg_regulatory_change_process.qmd >}}

## Research questions

The main research question RQ

RQ: What are approaches for aligning business processes with regulatory requirements to achieve regulatory compliance by design?

SQ-1: How can businesses identify relevant regulatory requirements? 

SQ-2: How can businesses analyze which business processes are affected by changes in requlatory requirements? 

SQ-3: How can businesses integrate compliance requirements into business process design?

SQ-4: How can businesses ensure compliance throughout the lifecycle of the impacted business processes?

## Search terms

- "business process management" and "regulatory compliance"
- "business process management" and "regulatory compliance" and "systematic literature review"
- "compliance risk management"
- "regulatory risk management"
- "managing regulatory compliance in business processes"

## Search query Web of Science

The search query is composed of four individual queries. The first two queries search for "business process management" or BPM in the title. The last two queries search for "business process engineering" or business process reengineering" in the title. 

1. (TI=("business process management" or BPM) AND (AB=("compliance") OR KP=("compliance"))) OR 
2. (TI=("business process management" or BPM) AND (AB=("regulat*") OR KP=("regulat*"))) OR 
3. (TI=("business process *engineering") AND (AB=(compliance) OR KP=(compliance))) OR 
4. (TI=("business process \*engineering") AND (AB=(regulat\*) OR KP=(regulat*)))

this query yields xx results on the Vlerick WoS subscription (core ...) which is limited to 10 years back.

- book articles

## Data extraction strategy

Queries have been formulated for each datasource. Where queries could be specified at a field level (WoS and SD) we looked for "business process management" in the title field.

## Synthesis of extracted data

## Examples of SLR

[05/10/2023] Looking in my Zotero library for articles with a title that contains "systematic literature review", the result is 7 hits:

- The first is @kitchenhamGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007 and there is a duplicate @keeleGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007.
- Second there are 3 SLR's where Van Looy is co-author (@moreno-montesdeocaSystematicLiteratureReview2015, @prodanovaHowBeneficialSocial2019, @ahmadBusinessProcessManagement2020).
- There is 1 SLR about BPMN extensions (@zarourSystematicLiteratureReview2019)
- Finally, there is one SLR about Open Science (@VICENTESAEZ2018428) which is not relevant to BP4RC.

[Compliance](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/conformance-vs-compliance)

[Conformance](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/conformance-vs-compliance)

Conformance refers to the act of adhering to a set of standards or requirements. It involves ensuring that a product, service, or system meets the specified expectations and performs as intended. Conformance can be viewed as a proactive approach to quality management, where the focus is on preventing defects and errors from occurring in the first place.

Conformance often involves the use of quality management systems, such as ISO 9001, which provide a framework for organizations to establish and maintain a culture of quality. These systems typically involve a set of procedures and processes that are designed to ensure that products and services consistently meet customer requirements and comply with relevant regulations.
