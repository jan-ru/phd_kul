## Conceptual model

There is an existing model published by OCEG (&Refentiv) that may be used as a reference. The 2018 version is attached and redrawn below (@RegulatoryChangeManagement2018).

## Examples of SLR

[05/10/2023] Looking in my Zotero library for articles with a title that contains "systematic literature review", the result is 7 hits:

- The first is @kitchenhamGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007 and there is a duplicate @keeleGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007.
- Second there are 3 SLR's where Van Looy is co-author (@moreno-montesdeocaSystematicLiteratureReview2015, @prodanovaHowBeneficialSocial2019, @ahmadBusinessProcessManagement2020).
- There is 1 SLR about BPMN extensions (@zarourSystematicLiteratureReview2019)
- Finally, there is one SLR about Open Science (@VICENTESAEZ2018428) which is not relevant to BP4RC.

[Conformance](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/conformance-vs-compliance)

Conformance refers to the act of adhering to a set of standards or requirements. It involves ensuring that a product, service, or system meets the specified expectations and performs as intended. Conformance can be viewed as a proactive approach to quality management, where the focus is on preventing defects and errors from occurring in the first place.

Conformance often involves the use of quality management systems, such as ISO 9001, which provide a framework for organizations to establish and maintain a culture of quality. These systems typically involve a set of procedures and processes that are designed to ensure that products and services consistently meet customer requirements and comply with relevant regulations.
