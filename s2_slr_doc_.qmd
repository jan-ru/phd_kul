Examples of SLR

[05/10/2023] Looking in my Zotero library for articles with a title that contains "systematic literature review", the result is 7 hits:

- The first is @kitchenhamGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007 and there is a duplicate @keeleGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007.
- Second there are 3 SLR's where Van Looy is co-author (@moreno-montesdeocaSystematicLiteratureReview2015, @prodanovaHowBeneficialSocial2019, @ahmadBusinessProcessManagement2020).
- There is 1 SLR about BPMN extensions (@zarourSystematicLiteratureReview2019)
- Finally, there is one SLR about Open Science (@VICENTESAEZ2018428) which is not relevant to BP4RC.

# Introduction

In the context of the DBA program at Vlerick Business School a literature review is one of two deliverables of year two. The research topic is "BPM for regulatory compliance". The goal of this review is to get an overview of relevant literature and identify topics listed as possibilities for future research. The type of literature review is a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR has been performed following the steps described in @kitchenhamGuidelinesPerformingSystematic2007.

@sec-research-questions states the main research question, three subquestions and provides for a definition of the central concepts.

@sec-review-plan is about the planning of the research. It describes the databases that were searched, the search terms used, the criteria for selecting articles and how the bibliographic data and the articles have been obtained.  

@sec-review-execution concerns the execution of the research. It describes the studies found, which studies have been selected, how the quality of the studies has been assessed, how the data was collected and a synthesis of the data. 

@sec-review-reporting concerns the reporting of the research. It describes how the results of this study will be shared, limitations of the study and possibilities for further research suggesting possible improvements.

# Research question(s){#sec-research-questions}

The research question (RQ) and the three supporting sub-questions (SQ) that are addressed in this literature review are:

RQ: What are approaches for aligning business processes with regulatory requirements to achieve regulatory compliance by design?

SQ1: How can businesses identify relevant regulatory requirements? 

SQ2: How can businesses analyze which business processes are affected by changes in regulatory requirements?  

SQ3: How can businesses integrate compliance requirements into business process design?  

<!--
SQ-4: How can businesses ensure compliance throughout the lifecycle of the impacted business processes? Comment: taken out as answering this sub-question does not help answering the main research question.

The focus of this review is specifically the first question (RQ). The following is the research question repeated whereby the central terms and and concepts in this review are boxed: What are approaches for aligning \fbox{business processes} with \fbox{regulatory requirements} to achieve regulatory \fbox{compliance by design}?  
  
A definition of the three central concepts:

Business process management (BPM) is a defined as all activities performed by businesses to discover, model, automate, analyze, measure, improve and optimize business processes (@liuStaticCompliancecheckingFramework2007). A business process coordinates the behavior of people, systems, information and things to produce business outcomes in support of a business strategy. Processes can be structured and repeatable, or unstructured and variable.

Regulatory compliance is defined as ensuring that business processes, operations, and practices are in accordance with a prescribed and/or agreed set of norms. These compliance requirements may stem from legislature and regulatory bodies (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley, Basel II, HIPAA), standards and codes of practice (e.g., SCOR, ISO9000), and also business partner contracts (@hashmiEvaluatingBusinessProcess2015).

Compliance by design refers to approaches and methodologies where compliance requirements are integrated into business process models (@sadiqManagingRegulatoryCompliance2010) and enterprise applications from the very beginning. This concept emphasizes embedding compliance within the fabric of business practices (@lohmannComplianceDesignArtifactcentric2013) rather than treating it as a separate or after-the-fact activity.
