    "text": "In the context of the DBA program at Vlerick Business School a literature review is one of two deliverables of year two. The research topic is “BPM for regulatory compliance”. The goal of this review is to get an overview of relevant literature and identify topics listed as possibilities for future research. The type of literature review is a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR has been performed following the steps described in Kitchenham and Charters (2007).\nChapter 2 states the main research question, three subquestions and provides for a definition of the central concepts.\nChapter 3 is about the planning of the research. It describes the databases that were searched, the search terms used, the criteria for selecting articles and how the bibliographic data and the articles have been obtained.\nChapter 4 concerns the execution of the research. It describes the studies found, which studies have been selected, how the quality of the studies has been assessed, how the data was collected and a synthesis of the data.\nChapter 5 concerns the reporting of the research. It describes how the results of this study will be shared, limitations of the study and possibilities for further research suggesting possible improvements.\n\n\n\n\nKitchenham, Barbara, and Stuart Charters. 2007. “Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering.”",

    "text": "The research question (RQ) and the three supporting sub-questions (SQ) that are addressed in this literature review are:\nRQ: What are approaches for aligning business processes with regulatory requirements to achieve regulatory compliance by design?\nSQ1: How can businesses identify relevant regulatory requirements?\nSQ2: How can businesses analyze which business processes are affected by changes in regulatory requirements?\nSQ3: How can businesses integrate compliance requirements into business process design?\n\nThe focus of this review is specifically the first question (RQ). The following is the research question repeated whereby the central terms and and concepts in this review are boxed: What are approaches for aligning with to achieve regulatory ?\n\ncompliance by design\n\nA definition of the three central concepts:\nBusiness process management (BPM) is a defined as all activities performed by businesses to discover, model, automate, analyze, measure, improve and optimize business processes (Liu, Müller, and Xu 2007). A business process coordinates the behavior of people, systems, information and things to produce business outcomes in support of a business strategy. Processes can be structured and repeatable, or unstructured and variable.\nRegulatory compliance is defined as ensuring that business processes, operations, and practices are in accordance with a prescribed and/or agreed set of norms. These compliance requirements may stem from legislature and regulatory bodies (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley, Basel II, HIPAA), standards and codes of practice (e.g., SCOR, ISO9000), and also business partner contracts (Hashmi (2015)).\nCompliance by design refers to approaches and methodologies where compliance requirements are integrated into business process models and enterprise applications from the very beginning (Sadiq and Governatori 2010). This concept emphasizes embedding compliance within the fabric of business practices rather than treating it as a separate or after-the-fact activity (Lohmann 2013).\n\n\n\n\nHashmi, Mustafa. 2015. “Evaluating Business Process Compliance Management Frameworks.” PhD thesis, Queensland University of Technology.\n\n\nLiu, Y., S.

    "text": "4.4 Synthesis of extracted data\n\n8-12 years ago: the two oldest papers in the dataset are Vanderfeesten, Reijers, and Van Der Aalst (2011) and Hadasch, Maedche, and Gregor (2016). The article of Irene Vanderfeesten is on the subject of her PhD thesis (Vanderfeesten, Reijers, and Van Der Aalst (2011)). It describes the concept of a Product Data Model which, in workflow systems, can be compared to a Bill of Material in manufacturing systems. The article doesn’t mention future research but does mention collaboration with industrial partners to incorporate a PDM in a commercial tool. The Hadasch paper is a quantitive study about users’ process compliance as a function of process explanations either in textual or diagram format (DE/DDE). Broadly stated, the paper concludes that the better explanations result in better compliance. Other than a recommendation that the findings of the paper be leveraged in future research, there is no specific guidance about future research.\n4-8 years ago: the four papers published in the 2016-2019 timeslot are Van Der Aalst (2018), Hashmi and Governatori (2017), Hashmi et al. (2018) and van der Aa, Leopold, and Reijers (2017). The van der Aalst paper compares and contrasts spreadsheet technology with process mining technology. It mentions checking for compliance as the activity whereby a process as run in reality is compared to a normative model. The article mentions future process mining research should be about automatically improving processes by changing underlying process models. The first Hashmi paper compares six Compliance Modeling Frameworks (CMFs). There are two pointers to future research directions. 1) Studying the formal semantics of the norms modeling languages. 2) Studying the useability of the norms modeling constructs in practice. The second Hashmi paper is a SLR where 79 papers were included in the study. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the attributes of compliance in BPM. There is a general direction for future research given: to improve modeling languages to take into account all compliance requirements. The article by van der Aa et al. is about the possible divergence of process descriptions and graphical process models. A quantitive analysis is performed on 53 real-life model-text pairs. One of the suggested future research directions is to also capture process information in other formats. Among the examples given of such other formats are rules and regulations.\n0-4 years ago: the three most recent papers in the set are the papers and Kir and Erdogan (2021), Bernardo Junior and De Padua (2023) and Viriyasitavat et al. (2023). The Kir paper introduces agileBPM, a modeling methodology. The main differentiator is that next to control flow agileBPM also captures knowledge, rules and goals. A prototype of the system is compared to other similar systems (ADEPT, SmartPM, Planlets, Go4Flex). The paper doesn’t mention future research. The Bernardo paper includes a SLR, interviews and expert consultations. Agile BPM is defined. Future research is suggested to be on practices necessary for empirical application of BPM in organizations. The Viriyasitavat article is a SLR on the use of blockchain technology for business process compliance. The paper argues that blockchain technologies can and are applied for business process compliance. Existing work has a focus on technical implementation of the functionalities of traditional BPM systems. However the use of blockchain technologies also allows for new functionalities. The further research section specifically mentions organizational and legal aspects.\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Relevance to research question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nArticle\nAlignment Concepts\nFuture Research\n\n\n\n\n1\n2011\nVanderfeesten et al.\nProductData Model\nN\n\n\n2\n2016\nHadasch et al.\n(Diagram)Descriptive Explanations\nN\n\n\n3\n2017\nVan der Aa et al.\nConsistency between representation\nY (specific)\n\n\n4\n2018\nVan Der Aalst\nPrescriptive Analytics\nY (general)\n\n\n5\n2018\nHashmi et al.\nCompliance Modeling Frameworks\nY (specific)\n\n\n6\n2018\nHashmi et al.\nCompliance Modeling Languages\nY (general)\n\n\n7\n2021\nKir et al.\nContext Awareness / Norm adoption\nN\n\n\n8\n2023\nViriyasitavat et al.\nBlockchain\nY (general)\n\n\n9\n2023\nBernardo Junior et al.\n-\nY (general)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll papers mention approaches for alignment of business processes with regulatory requirements except the Bernardo Junior paper about agile BPM.\nFrom these 9 papers reviewed, 6 mention future research directions.

(IF: 3)\nSummary of the Related Work\nBusiness process modelling (BPM) and business‐process simulation (BPS) help to facilitate process thinking. (Barber et. al., 2003) suggest a practical way forward until hardware and software limitations are overcome. As enterprises increasingly use business process management systems to automate their business processes, technologies to automatically check the compliance of process models against compliance rules are becoming important. (Liu et. al., 2007) present a method to improve the reliability and minimize the risk of failure of business process management systems from a compliance perspective. This is because, especially with regulatory compliance, both business and government have to expect large financial and reputational losses if compliance cannot be ensured and demonstrated. (Lang et. al., 2008) illustrate the theory behind Model Driven Security for compliance, provide an improved and extended architecture, as well as a case study in the healthcare industry using the OpenPMF 2.0 technology. Regulatory compliance of business operations and practices is increasingly becoming an area of great concern for management, costing tens of billions of dollars in compliance actions a year. (Araujo et. al., 2010) present a method for validating business processes with respect to the business rules. In the discipline of business process management in particular, compliance is considered as an important driver of the efficiency, reliability and market value of companies. For this purpose (Kharbili et. al., 2011) contribute CoReL, a domain-specific modeling language for representing compliance requirements that has a graphical concrete syntax. Legal Knowledge Management systems that combine repositories of legislation with legal ontologies can support the work of in-house compliance managers. (Boella et. al., 2013) extend the Legal Knowledge Management system Eunomos to deal with alternative interpretations of norms connecting it with Business Process Management systems. (Elgammal et. al., 2014) propose a semantically-enabled compliance management framework. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating regulatory, business and compliance knowledge; i.e., CMKB. (Sadiq et. al., 2015) present an overarching methodology for aligning business and control objectives. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the role of BPM as a driver for regulatory compliance and a presentation of open questions and challenges. In the business process compliance management literature, (Delfmann et. al., 2015) find an abundance of approaches supporting business process compliance checking. With this objective of (Delfmann et. al., 2015) at making a step towards comprehensive catalogues of compliance rules that can be used as input for business process compliance checking approaches. By definition, regulatory rules (in legal context called norms) intend to achieve specific behaviour from business processes, and might be relevant to the whole or part of a business process. (Hashmi et. al., 2016) present an abstract framework consisting of a list of norms and a generic compliance checking approach on the idea of (possible) execution of processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernardo Junior, Ronaldo, and Silvia Ines Dallavalle De Padua. 2023. “Toward Agile Business Process Management: Description of Concepts and a Proposed Definition.” Knowl Process Manag 30 (1): 14–32. https://doi.org/10.1002/kpm.1737.\n\n\nHadasch, Frank, Alexander Maedche, and Shirley Gregor. 2016. “The Influence of Directive Explanations on Users’ Business Process Compliance Performance.” Business Process Management Journal 22 (3): 458–83. https://doi.org/10.1108/BPMJ-05-2015-0067.\n\n\nHashmi, Mustafa, and Guido Governatori. 2017. “Norms Modeling Constructs of Business Process Compliance Management Frameworks: A Conceptual Evaluation.” Artificial Intelligence and Law 26 (September): 251–305. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-017-9215-8.\n\n\nHashmi, Mustafa, Guido Governatori, Ho-Pun Lam, and Moe Thandar Wynn. 2018. “Are We Done with Business Process Compliance: State of the Art and Challenges Ahead.” Knowl Inf Syst 57 (1): 79–133. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-017-1142-1.\n\n\nKir, Huseyin, and Nadia Erdogan. 2021. “A Knowledge-Intensive Adaptive Business Process Management Framework.” Information Systems 95 (January): 101639. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2020.101639.\n\n\nvan der Aa, Han, Henrik Leopold, and Hajo A.

Examples of notable differences are:\n\nfor WoS: the search results may differ depending on the subscription that is available to the user.\nfor SD: the search results may differ as query’s are interpreted based on language heuristics (source). Also, SD does not support wildcards.\nfor dblp: the CompleteSearch engine autocompletes search terms, see Bast and Weber (2006).\nfor arXiv: wildcards can not be used as the first character of a search term (source).

(2010), p. 11 reference research that has been performed under the 2008-2011 COMPAS research project funded by the EU and coordinated by the Technische Universitaet Wien. More information about the research output of these projects will be available via OpenAIRE. When OpenAIRE will be included as a data source we will also again include Zenodo. Zenodo was created as part of the OpenAIRE initiative.\nFor reproducibility a future version of this literature review shall have the protocol altered. For commercial databases one and the same query can yield different results if it is run with two different licenses. This has been found to be the case with Web of Science. For the query used in this review the Vlerick Business School license of WoS yielded 42 hits while the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences license of WoS yield 24 hits (to be included in appendix). It is assumed the average user does not have precise information of the licenses that Academic institutions hold. As such WoS is better not used in the early stages of the search. The protocol could instead dictate the use of open databases, such as OpenAlex, for the early stages of the search. Commercial databases would then be used in a later stage to get abstracts and full texts of selected articles that are not available from open databases.\nFor quality assessment we have now used a self-constructed indicator (QA4) that has as inputs the number of publications by the first and second author. If further research is conducted it can be considered to replace this indicator with the ubiquitous h-index (Poirrier, Moreno, and Huerta-Canepa (2021)). Also, the fact that only 1 article is from the eligible journals list seems to indicate that either the list needs to be revised. Alternatively a different indicator, such as the journal impact factor, can be a substitute quality indicator.\nFinally, where it relates to compliance checks, in the literature there is a divide between “design time” and “run time”. As the RQ of this research refers to , future research may have more of different search terms to also filter research about “design time” compliance checking.\n\n\n\n\n\nBast, Holger, and Ingmar Weber. 2006. “Type Less, Find More: Fast Autocompletion Search with a Succinct Index.” In Proceedings of the 29th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 364–71.
